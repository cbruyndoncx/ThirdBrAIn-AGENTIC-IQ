The Company\u2019s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents. Patents applicable to\nspecific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various\ncountries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of\npatent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.\n \nThe Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or group of\nrelated patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company\u2019s business segments.\n \nRaw Materials\n \nIn 2018, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across most material markets worldwide. In response, the Company continued to deploy\nproductivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and\nmulti-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the\nCompany is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future\nshortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful\nmanagement of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources.\n3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\n \nEnvironmental Law Compliance\n \n3M\u2019s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to continue making,\nnecessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past\noperations at certain sites (refer to \u201cEnvironmental Matters and Litigation\u201d in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).\n \nEnvironmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed.\nReserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally\nno later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company\u2019s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental\nexpenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\n \nIn 2018, 3M expended approximately $27 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for\nremediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are expensed. Capital\nexpenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices \u2014 such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers,\ncontainment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers \u2014 at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of\nbusiness. Consistent with the Company\u2019s emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known\nprojects are presently expected to be approximately $75 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify\nmanufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.\n \n7", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5042, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22b1c867-e7b3-4dbe-922e-9b2379605909": {"__data__": {"id_": "22b1c867-e7b3-4dbe-922e-9b2379605909", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ea8436d-3275-40c6-873d-7bda2e1292a2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "eacd7bed69857a8c3b9fc7837d15c83979ca7600c49852cdfc2add316753266a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\n \nWhile the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental\ncompliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\n \nExecutive Officers\n \nFollowing is a list of the executive officers of 3M, and their age, present position, the year elected to their present position and other positions they have\nheld during the past five years.

Actual\nfuture results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of\nfactors. Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among others, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the headings of \u201cOverview,\u201d \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d and annually in \u201cCritical\nAccounting Estimates.\u201d Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d of this document, and should be\nconsidered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d For additional\ninformation concerning factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on\nForm 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time.\n \nItem 1A.  \nRisk Factors\n \n \n \nProvided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion of these factors\nis incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part I, Item 2, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and\nResults of Operations.\u201d\n \n* Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions.\n The Company operates in more\nthan 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. The Company\u2019s business is subject to global\ncompetition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as\nslower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions,\ninflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government actions impacting international trade agreements, imposing trade\nrestrictions such as tariffs, and retaliatory counter measures, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in\nthe various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters or\nclimate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest\nrates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\n \n* Change in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.\n The Company\u2019s credit ratings are important to 3M\u2019s cost of capital. The major\nrating agencies routinely evaluate the Company\u2019s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which\ninclude financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has\nan AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor\u2019s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service. The\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings have served to lower 3M\u2019s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the\nCompany\u2019s capital structure could impact 3M\u2019s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n \n* The Company\u2019s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\n Demand for the Company\u2019s products, which impacts revenue\nand profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company\u2019s response to downward\npricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of\ncustomer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company\u2019s incentive programs, or the customer\u2019s ability to achieve\nincentive goals; (iv) changes in customers\u2019 preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in\ncustomer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company\u2019s products;

The earnings per share impact reflects the specific\nincome tax rate used for this divestiture.\n \nOrganic growth/productivity and other:\n\u00b7\nFourth quarter and full year 2018 year-on-year benefits include higher organic local-currency sales, selling price increases, and business\ntransformation, which is having a positive impact on 3M\u2019s productivity efforts. Higher raw material costs partially offset these year-on-year\nbenefits.\n\u00b7\nLower year-on-year restructuring (other than activity related to the Communication Markets Division divestiture), portfolio and footprint actions\nincreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $58 million and $307 million in the fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively. These charges\nincluded $24 million related to exit activities and $80 million in asset charges, accelerated depreciation and other costs taken in the first quarter\nof 2017, $99 million in restructuring actions and $51 million in asset charges, accelerated depreciation and other costs taken in the second quarter\nof 2017, $35 million in asset charges, accelerated depreciation and other costs taken in the third quarter of 2017, in addition to $23 million\nrelated to exit activities and $41 million in asset charges, accelerated depreciation and other costs taken in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n \nAcquisitions/other divestiture gains:\n\u00b7\nIn aggregate, acquisitions, year-on-year divestitures gains (other than the sale of the Communication Markets Division and identity management\nbusiness), and lost operating income from divested businesses (other than lost income related to the  divestiture of the Communication Markets\nDivision) decreased earnings per diluted share by 12 cents year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2018 and decreased earnings per diluted share by\n10 cents for full year 2018.\n\u00b7\nRemaining stranded costs and lost operating income related to the divestiture of the Communication Markets Division decreased earnings per\ndiluted share by 3 cents and 5 cents year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2018 and full year 2018, respectively.\n16", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4216, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "530ccfd7-9358-4605-bd9a-65612ddfaa54": {"__data__": {"id_": "530ccfd7-9358-4605-bd9a-65612ddfaa54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "68571df3-fbc3-489c-ba09-a1ac1203e6de", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "bf0bd19417c052aaa1a24b1acb72fa7a2fa4069c1b6f649040a3326c7385a493", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\n \nForeign exchange impacts:\n\u00b7\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings year-on-year by approximately $27 million and approximately $42 million,\nor the equivalent of 3 cents and 5 cents per diluted share, for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively, excluding the impact of foreign\ncurrency changes on tax rates.\n \nLegal-related charges\n\u00b7\nIn the second quarter of 2018, 3M reached agreements in principle on a number of respiratory mask/asbestos claims and an oral care product\nliability matter, the implications of which resulted in an increase in certain legal accruals. Refer to Note 16 for further details.\n \nOther expense:\n\u00b7\nFourth quarter 2018\u2019s interest expense (net of interest income) decreased $72 million, primarily due to the $96 million early extinguishment of\ndebt charge in the fourth quarter 2017 that was not repeated in 2018.

Excluding the $762 million impact related to the enactment of the TCJA in the\nfourth quarter of 2017, the effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017 was 23.0 percent and 25.4 percent,\nrespectively.\n\u00b7\nFactors that decreased the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 primarily related to the favorable aspects of the TCJA such\nas the decrease in the U.S. income tax rate and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), reduced transitional impact of TCJA related to\ntransition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities (further discussed below), and increased benefits from the R&D tax credit.\nThese decreases were partially offset by the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, the global intangible low-taxed income\n(GILTI) provision, and lower excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments. Refer to Note 10 for additional details.\n \nShares of common stock outstanding:\n\u00b7\nLower shares outstanding increased earnings per share by 8 cents and 18 cents per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full year 2018,\nrespectively. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 declined 3.4 percent and 1.8 percent year-on-\nyear, respectively, which benefited earnings per share. The decrease in the outstanding weighted-average diluted shares relates to the Company\u2019s\npurchase of $1.3 billion and $4.9 billion of its own stock in the fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively.\n17", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3949, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8aeccaa7-9b2a-4d2a-bbc0-a6512a12c589": {"__data__": {"id_": "8aeccaa7-9b2a-4d2a-bbc0-a6512a12c589", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7103f5b8-d3f2-490e-a1b0-e3a282d79732", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "2f57b8330e168d5eff279a4f6a39f3b0ca9e136358f97ad904f3f842e234b29a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\n \n \n2018 divestiture of Communication Markets Division, net of related restructuring actions and exit activities:\n\u00b7\nIn June 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $494 million as a\nresult of this divestiture. Additionally in December 2018, 3M completed the sale of the remaining telecommunications system integration\nservices portion of the business based in Germany and reflected a pre-tax gain of $15 million as a result of this divestiture. Both divestitures were\nreported within the Company\u2019s Electronics and Energy business.  During the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2018, management approved\nand committed to undertake certain restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets\nDivision divestiture. These actions affected approximately 1,200 positions worldwide and resulted in a second quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of\n$105 million and a fourth quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of $22 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates. The aggregate net\nimpact of the gain on sale and related restructuring actions increased earnings per diluted share by 2 cents and 50 cents per diluted share for the\nfourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively, and reflects the specific income tax rate associated with these items.\n \nYear 2017 EPS:\n \n2017 divestiture of identity management business\n:\n\u00b7\nIn May 2017, \n3M completed the related sale or transfer of control, as applicable of its identity management business and reflected a pre-tax gain\nof $457 million. The earnings per share impact reflects the specific income tax rate used for this divestiture.\n \nOrganic growth/productivity and other:\n\u00b7\nOrganic growth/productivity in 2017 included benefits from higher organic local-currency sales, raw material cost decreases from sourcing cost\nreduction projects, and business transformation, which had a positive impact on 3M\u2019s productivity efforts. These benefits were partially offset by\nhigher defined benefit pension service cost expenses. During 2017, organic growth and productivity were the primary drivers for the year-on-year\nbenefit.\n\u00b7\nYear-on-year incremental strategic investments decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $413 million in 2017. These incremental strategic\ninvestments are comprised of 3M\u2019s investments in growth initiatives and optimization of its portfolio and supply chain footprint.\n \nAcquisitions/other divestiture gains:\n\u00b7\nAcquisitions and divestitures (other than the sale of the identity management business) had a neutral impact to earnings per diluted share for full\nyear 2017. Acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, related primarily to the acquisition of Scott\nSafety (fourth quarter 2017). The net impact related to Scott Safety included income from operations, more than offset by the transaction and\nintegration costs of the acquisition. Interest expense related to financing costs of Scott Safety are also included. The net impact related to Scott\nSafety was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 7 cents per diluted share. Full year 2017 had year-on-year operating income impacts from the\nfollowing divestitures: Polyfoam and the remaining portion of the library system business (both in first quarter 2016), protective films business\nand cathode battery technology out-license business (both in fourth quarter 2016), prescription safety eyewear business (January 2017), tolling\nand automated license/number plate recognition business (second quarter of 2017), and electronic monitoring business (fourth quarter 2017). The\nincremental year-on-year pre-tax gain on divestiture impact, net of lost operating loss/(income) during 2017 was an increase of approximately 7\ncents per diluted share.\n \nForeign exchange impacts:\n\u00b7\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $111 million year-on-year in 2017, excluding the impact\nof foreign currency changes on tax rates. This is equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 13 cents per diluted share for the full year 2017.\n \nLegal \u2013 respirator mask actuarial reserve\n\u00b7\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the Company\u2019s regular review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, the Company increased its\naccruals.

Selling prices were flat year-on-year for 2017. In Asia Pacific, strong volume growth in electronics had a\nnegative impact on price. Latin America/Canada and EMEA had price growth, while the U.S. selling prices declined slightly.\n \nFinancial condition:\n \n3M generated $6.4 billion of operating cash flow in 2018, an increase of $199 million when compared to 2017. This followed a decrease of $422 million\nwhen comparing 2017 to 2016. Refer to the section entitled \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash\nflows. In November 2018, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M\u2019s outstanding common stock, which replaced the\nCompany\u2019s February 2016 repurchase program. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2018, the Company purchased $4.9 billion of its own\nstock, compared to purchases of $2.1 billion in 2017 and $3.8 billion in 2016. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion of its own stock\nin 2019. In February 2019, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2019 dividend of $1.44 per share, an increase of 6 percent. This marked the\n61st consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. The Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor\u2019s and an A1\ncredit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody\u2019s Investors Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital\nmarkets funding throughout business cycles.\n \nRaw materials:\n \nIn 2018, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across most material markets worldwide. In response, the Company continued to deploy\nproductivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and\nmulti-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the\nCompany is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future\nshortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful\nmanagement of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources.\n3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\n \n \nPension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:\n \nOn a worldwide basis, 3M\u2019s pension and postretirement plans were 89 percent funded at year-end 2018. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is\napproximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 96 percent funded and the international pension plans were 89 percent funded. The U.S.\nnon-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2018 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were -\n0.5%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified\npension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2019 is 7.00%. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2018\ndiscount rate was 4.36%, up 0.68 percentage points from the year-end 2017 discount rate of 3.68%. The increase in U.S. discount rates resulted in a\ndecrease valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plan\u2019s funded status increased 2 percentage points in 2018\ndue to the lower PBO resulting from the significant discount rate increase and a $200 million contribution to the plan.

A number of factors impact the various income statement line items, such as raw material\ncost management, portfolio and footprint actions, divestitures, foreign currency, cost management, and pension and postretirement service cost effects.\nExpanded discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various sections below. Pension and postretirement service cost expense is\nrecorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses (R&D). In total, 3M\u2019s\ndefined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense increased $21 million in 2018, compared to an increase of $16 million in 2017. Refer to\nNote 13 (Pension and Postretirement Plans) for the service cost components of net periodic benefit costs.\n \nThe Company is investing in an initiative called business transformation, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. Business\ntransformation encompasses the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, as well\nas changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M.\n \nCost of Sales:\n \nCost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.\n \nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, increased during 2018 primarily due to foreign currency effects (net of hedge losses). Additionally, cost of\nsales for full year 2018 were increased by the second quarter 2018 and fourth quarter 2018 Communication Markets Division related restructuring charges\nas discussed in Note 5. This increase was partially offset by 2017 portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges that did not repeat in 2018, and\nselling price increases. Selling prices increased net sales year-on-year by 1.1 percent for full year 2018. These were partially offset by raw material cost\nincreases and higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense.\n \nCost of sales as a percent of sales increased during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments in productivity, portfolio actions and footprint\noptimization, foreign currency effects (net of hedge impacts) and higher defined benefit pension expense. This was partially offset by a year-on-year\nreduction in raw material input costs as a result of sourcing cost reduction projects.

In addition, 3M divested a polymer additives compounding business, formerly part of the Company\u2019s Industrial business, and reflected a gain\non final closing adjustments from a prior divestiture which, in aggregate, were not material. These divestitures resulted in a gain on sale of businesses of\n$24 million. 3M also divested an abrasives glass products business, formerly part of the Company\u2019s Industrial business, which resulted in a gain on sale of\nless than $15 million in the second quarter of 2018. Also, 3M reflected an immaterial gain from an earnout on a previous divestiture in the fourth quarter of\n2018.\n \nIn June 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division to Corning Incorporated. This business, with annual sales\nof approximately $400 million, consists of optical fiber and copper passive connectivity solutions for the telecommunications industry including 3M\u2019s\nxDSL, FTTx, and structured cabling solutions and, in certain countries, telecommunications system integration services. This divestiture resulted in a gain\non sale of $494 million. In December 2018, the Company completed the sale of the remaining telecommunications system integration services portion of\nthe business based in Germany, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $15 million. Both the June 2018 and December 2018 divestiture impacts were reported within\nthe Company\u2019s Electronics and Energy business.\n \nRefer to Note 3 for additional detail on these divestitures. 3M also divested certain businesses in 2017 and 2016, resulting in gains of $586 million and $111\nmillion, respectively.

operating income margins follows:\n \n2017 divestiture of identity management business:\n\u00b7\nOperating income margins decreased year-on-year due to the gain on the May 2017 divestiture of the Company\u2019s former identity management\nbusiness.\n \nOrganic volume/productivity and other:\n\u00b7\nOperating income margins increased year-on-year due to benefits from organic local-currency growth and productivity, in addition to lower year-\non-year portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges.\n\u00b7\nOperating income margins decreased year-on-year due to higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined\ncontribution expense.\n \nAcquisitions/other divestiture gains:\n\u00b7\nAcquisition impacts (primarily related to Scott Safety), in addition to lower year-on-year divestiture gains (excluding the identity management\nbusiness and Communication Markets), decreased operating margins year-on-year.\n\u00b7\nRemaining stranded costs to be addressed from the divestiture of the Communication Markets Division reduced operating margins year-on-year.\n\u00b7\nOperating income margins increased year-on-year due to the lost lower-margin

Year-on-year pension and postretirement net periodic benefit non-service costs increased $55 million and $68 million for the year 2018 and 2017,\nrespectively.

The effective tax rate for 2017 was\n35.5 percent, compared to 28.3 percent in 2016, an increase of 7.2 percentage points. The changes in the tax rates between years were impacted by many\nfactors, including the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017 as further described in the Overview, \u201c\nIncome, earnings per\nshare, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -(non-GAAP measures)\u201d \nsection and in Note 10.

Financial\ninformation and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective in the first quarter of 2018, as part of 3M\u2019s\ncontinuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the following changes:\n \nConsolidation of customer account activity within international countries \u2013 expanding dual credit reporting\n\u00b7\nThe Company consolidated its customer account activity in each country into centralized sales districts for certain countries that make up\napproximately 70 percent of 3M\u2019s 2017 international net sales. Expansion of these initiatives, which previously had been deployed only in the\nU.S., reduces the complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3M businesses. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual\ncredit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides\ncustomer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country. The expansion of alignment of customer accounts within\nadditional countries increased the attribution of dual credit across 3M\u2019s business segments. Additionally, certain sales and operating income\nresults for electronic bonding product lines that were previously equally divided between the Electronics and Energy business segment and the\nIndustrial business segment are now reported similarly to dual credit.\n \nCentralization of manufacturing and supply technology platforms\n\u00b7\nCertain shared film manufacturing and supply technology platform resources formerly reflected within the Electronics and Energy business\nsegment were combined with other shared and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise within Corporate and Unallocated.\n \nIn addition, as discussed in Note 1, 3M adopted ASU No. 2017-07, \nImproving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic\nPostretirement Benefit Cost\n, effective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. As a result, operating income for 3M\u2019s business segments has been revised\nto reflect non-service components of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit costs within other expense (income), net.\n \nBusiness segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in five business\nsegments. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer.\n \nCorporate and Unallocated:\n \nIn addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to \u201cCorporate and Unallocated,\u201d which is presented separately in the preceding\nbusiness segments table and in Note 18. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and\nlosses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring\ncharges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its\nbusiness segments. Corporate and Unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other\narrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its divestiture in 2018. Because this category includes a variety of\nmiscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n \nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $1.1 billion in full year 2018 when compared to full year 2017. Beginning in the second quarter\nof 2018, the operating income from contractual manufacturing and other arrangements described in the paragraph above were included in Corporate and\nUnallocated. In addition, in the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2018, operating expenses included the restructuring charge of $105 million and $22\nmillion, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates, respectively, as discussed in Note 5 related to addressing corporate functional costs following\nthe Communication Markets Division divestiture.

A portion of the products or components sold by 3M\u2019s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different\ngeographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M\u2019s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular\ngeographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area.

As stated in Note 1, the preparation of\nfinancial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,\nand related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are\nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n \nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement obligations, asset\nimpairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the\nAudit Committee of 3M\u2019s Board of Directors.\n \nLegal Proceedings:\n \nThe categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related\ninsurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cProcess for Disclosure and\nRecording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings\u201d (contained in \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Note 16) for additional information\nabout such estimates.\n \n \nPension and Postretirement Obligations:\n \n \n3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The\nprimary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension\nand postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, \nCompensation \u2014\nRetirement Benefits\n, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires\nemployers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of\nfinancial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income,\nwhich is a component of stockholders\u2019 equity.

See Note 13 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in\ndetermining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.\n \nPension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant\u2019s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or\ntermination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of\nthe measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period\nand discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments\nthat would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately\nusing the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to\nthe service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit\npayments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in\nthe actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.\n \nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\n \n \nU.S. Qualified\nPension\n    \nInternational\nPension (weighted\naverage)\n    \nU.S.\nPostretirement\nMedical\n \nDecember 31, 2018 Liability:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBenefit obligation\n \n4.36\n%\n2.50\n%\n4.28\n%\n2019 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nService cost\n \n4.47\n%\n2.36\n%\n4.45\n%\nInterest cost\n \n4.04\n%\n2.26\n%\n3.93\n%\n \nAnother significant element in determining the Company\u2019s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is\nbased on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management.\nFor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2019 is 7.00%, a decrease from 7.25% in 2018.\nRefer to Note 13 for information on how the 2018 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement\nbenefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions.

Management\nmakes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This\nincludes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are\nclosely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an\nimpairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group.\n \nOf the $2.7 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily Capital Safety, whose tradenames ($520\nmillion at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 4 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating\nthe fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to\nestimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated\nroyalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. If the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book\nvalue of the indefinite lived intangible asset, impairment exists, and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter\nof 2018, no impairment was indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradenames exceeded its book value by more than 20 percent\nin aggregate.\n \n3M goodwill totaled approximately $10.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. 3M\u2019s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of\neach year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level\nbelow the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At\n3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing.\n \nAn impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit,\nand the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a\nprice/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for\nstable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted\ncash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method\nindicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than\nplanned due to economic or other conditions.\n \nAs described in Note 18, effective in the first quarter of 2018, 3M made business segment reporting changes. For any product moves that resulted in\nreporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the\nfirst quarter of 2018, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and\ndetermined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2018 annual impairment test and is in the context of\nthe reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\n \nAs of October 1, 2018, 3M had 24 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 89 percent of the goodwill. These ten\nreporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health\nInformation Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification, and\nTransportation Safety.

The weighting was based on management\u2019s estimates of the\nlikelihood of each scenario occurring.\n \n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M\u2019s\nbusinesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M\u2019s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M\u2019s value being comprised\nof internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2018, no goodwill\nimpairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.\n \nFactors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive\nconditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d of\nthis document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. As indicated above, during the first\nquarter of 2018, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting\nunits and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M\nwould expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in\n2019 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n \n \nIncome Taxes:\n \nThe extent of 3M\u2019s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of\njurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of\ndisputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax\naudit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The\nCompany follows guidance provided by ASC 740, \nIncome Taxes\n, regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 10 for\nadditional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these\nuncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company\u2019s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the\nCompany\u2019s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these\namounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period\nwhen the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n \nStarting in the fourth quarter of 2017 and continuing into 2018, 3M recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n(TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA\u2019s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and remeasurement of\n3M\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Investing in 3M\u2019s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital\ndeployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be\nsupplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for\ncash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund\ndividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities\nfor 3M to access international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs. For those\ninternational earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S.\noperations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n \n3M\u2019s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to\nthe commercial paper market. 3M\u2019s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum\nmaturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2018, there was approximately $435 million in commercial paper issued and outstanding.\n \nTotal Debt:\n \nThe strength of 3M\u2019s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company\u2019s\nmaturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA-\ncredit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor\u2019s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\n \nThe Company\u2019s total debt was $0.7 billion higher at December 31, 2018 when compared to December 31, 2017. Increases in debt related to September\n2018 debt issuances of $2.25 billion along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency\neffects. These were partially offset by August 2018 and November 2018 maturation of $450 million and 500 million Euro, respectively, aggregate principal\namount of medium-term notes in addition to commercial paper of $435 million outstanding at year end 2018 compared to $745 million outstanding at year\nend 2017.

In addition, in 2017, this included a payment related to the $96 million in interest expense associated with premiums and fees for the early retirement\nof debt. See Note 12 for additional details.\n \nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):\n \nFree cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be\nconsidered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used\nby other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It\nshould not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as\nfree cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as\nthey are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate\ncash. The first quarter of each year is typically 3M\u2019s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash flow and\nfree cash flow conversion for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n \nIn 2018, free cash flow conversion was impacted by the $176 million measurement period adjustment to the tax expense recorded in December 2017 from\nthe enactment of the TCJA, the $897 million pre-tax impact related to the resolution of the Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD), and the $381\nmillion pre-tax impact from the gain on sale of the Communication Markets Division, net of restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional\ncosts following the divestiture. On a combined basis, these items reduced free cash flow conversion by 2 percentage points.\n \nIn 2017, free cash flow conversion was impacted by enactment of the TCJA, along with an additional U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that 3M\nmade following the signing of tax reform. On a combined basis, these items benefited free cash flow conversion by 3 percentage points.

The expense is primarily\nrelated to the TCJA\u2019s transition tax. The transition tax is payable over 8 years at the election of the taxpayer. As discussed in Note 10, this balance was\nfinalized in 2018.\n \nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company.\nIncluded in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service\nagreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase\nobligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure\navailability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional\npurchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company\u2019s\nexpected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for\nwhich the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M\u2019s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment.\nFor this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company\u2019s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.\n \nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled \u201cUnconditional purchase obligations and other,\u201d include the current portion of\nthe liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months, when applicable. The Company is\nnot able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments, or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the\nlong-term portion of the total net tax liability of $655 million is excluded from the preceding table. In addition, the transition tax prescribed under the Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is separately included in the table above. Refer to Note 10 for further details.\n \nAs discussed in Note 13, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2019 and Company\ncontributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are\nnot included in the preceding table.\n \nFINANCIAL INSTRUMEN\n \nTS\n \nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows\ndenominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4216, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d23de89-8250-4869-8352-8da8d5b34a1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d23de89-8250-4869-8352-8da8d5b34a1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "090fc1b6-4218-4803-b3d4-9c0ad42b4b46", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "01d830a9364be7bf174d9200608ab3a99b3db9bb85eb081c5dda99eba99ae715", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "42b0a625-44b2-4500-8272-e418b5ebb657", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "c0cfab1c0c6151afbf848a0bcb7968d2b019e0c6c5d3382ca012bdc6aaa60e01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In addition, the transition tax prescribed under the Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is separately included in the table above.

Changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Senior management provides oversight for risk\nmanagement and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company\u2019s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative\ninstrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit\napproval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\n \nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and\nforward and option contracts. However, the Company\u2019s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to\ncredit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The\nCompany does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n \nForeign Exchange Rates Risk:\n \nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations\nin cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The\nCompany enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in\nforeign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the\noccurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the\nforecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to\noffset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing\ntransactions). As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging\ninstruments to hedge portions of the Company\u2019s net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s\nforeign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $3.4 billion at December 31, 2018. The\ndollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was $2.5\nbillion at December 31, 2018. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Company had 4.1 billion Euros in principal amount of foreign currency\ndenominated debt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 14 in the \u201cNet Investment\nHedges\u201d section.\n \nInterest Rates Risk:\n \nThe Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense\nusing a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges.\nUnder these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by\nreference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional\namount of the Company\u2019s interest rate swaps at December 31, 2018 was $2.4 billion. Additional details about 3M\u2019s long-term debt can be found in Note\n12, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 14, associated with the Company\u2019s\nlong-term debt.\n \nCommodity Prices Risk:\n \nThe Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. The related\nmark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in\nthe period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. The Company may enter into other commodity price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuation\nand costs associated with the use of certain commodities and\n51", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5014, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cebda2b4-1e5a-44a4-8260-0fa56dabcc60": {"__data__": {"id_": "cebda2b4-1e5a-44a4-8260-0fa56dabcc60", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1f1d771-ef8e-4b8e-838b-d290c797f90a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "dc3b122e51310030f20ce73c80998efdbb7af362824f34e4013e52475bb67946", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\n \nprecious metals. These instruments are not designated in hedged relationships and the extent to which they were outstanding at December 31, 2018 was not\nmaterial.\n \nValue At Risk:\n \nThe value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the Company\u2019s sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. A\nMonte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to financial instruments (primarily debt), derivatives and\nunderlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2018. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time\nhorizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used 9 currencies, interest rates related to two currencies, and commodity prices related to five\ncommodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge\ntransactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results.

This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on\nthe transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to\nreduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by\napproximately $92 million and $152 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n \nAn analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. A one percent price change would result\nin a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $75 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a ten percent price change would result in a pre-\ntax cost or savings of approximately $42 million per year.

of Contents\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n \nNOTE 1.  Significant Accounting Policies\n \n \nConsolidation:\n 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All subsidiaries are consolidated.\nAll intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term \u201c3M\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context\nindicates otherwise.\n \nForeign currency translation:\n Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States. Assets and liabilities for\noperations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at\nmonth-end exchange rates of each applicable month. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) in shareholders\u2019 equity.\n \n3M has a subsidiary in Venezuela, the financial statements of which are remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent because Venezuela\u2019s\neconomic environment is considered highly inflationary. The operating income of this subsidiary is immaterial as a percent of 3M\u2019s consolidated operating\nincome for 2018. The Venezuelan government sets official rates of exchange and conditions precedent to purchase foreign currency at these rates with local\ncurrency. The government has also operated various expanded secondary currency exchange mechanisms that have been eliminated and replaced from time\nto time. Such rates and conditions have been and continue to be subject to change. For the periods presented, the financial statements of 3M\u2019s Venezuelan\nsubsidiary were remeasured utilizing the rate associated with the secondary auction mechanism, Tipo de Cambio Complementario, which was redesigned\nby the Venezuelan government in June 2017 (DICOM), or its predecessor. During the same periods, the Venezuelan government\u2019s official exchange was\nTipo de Cambio Protegido (DIPRO), or its predecessor. During the third quarter of 2018, the Venezuelan government effected a conversion of its currency\nto the Sovereign Bolivar (VES), essentially equating to its previous Venezuelan Bolivar divided by 100,000. 3M\u2019s uses of these rates were based upon\nevaluation of a number of factors including, but not limited to, the exchange rate the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary may legally use to convert\ncurrency, settle transactions or pay dividends; the probability of accessing and obtaining currency by use of a particular rate or mechanism; and the\nCompany\u2019s intent and ability to use a particular exchange mechanism. The Company continues to monitor these circumstances. Changes in applicable\nexchange rates or exchange mechanisms may continue in the future. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a balance of net monetary liabilities\ndenominated in VES of approximately 30 million VES and the DICOM exchange rate was approximately 556 VES per U.S. dollar.\n \nA need to deconsolidate the Company\u2019s Venezuelan subsidiary\u2019s operations may result from a lack of exchangeability of VEF-denominated cash coupled\nwith an acute degradation in the ability to make key operational decisions due to government regulations in Venezuela. 3M monitors factors such as its\nability to access various exchange mechanisms; the impact of government regulations on the Company\u2019s ability to manage its Venezuelan subsidiary\u2019s\ncapital structure, purchasing, product pricing, and labor relations; and the current political and economic situation within Venezuela. Based upon a review\nof factors as of December 31, 2018, the Company continues to consolidate its Venezuelan subsidiary. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss associated with this subsidiary was approximately $145 million and the amount of intercompany receivables due\nfrom this subsidiary and its total equity balance were not significant.\n \n3M has subsidiaries in Argentina, the operating income of which is less than one half of one percent of 3M\u2019s consolidated operating income for 2018.\nBased on various indices, Argentina\u2019s cumulative three-year inflation rate exceeded 100 percent in the second quarter of 2018, thus being considered highly\ninflationary. As a result, beginning in the third quarter of 2018, the financial statements of the Argentine subsidiaries were remeasured as if their functional\ncurrency were that of their parent. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a balance of net monetary assets denominated in Argentine pesos (ARS) of\napproximately 230 million ARS and the exchange rate was approximately 38 ARS per U.S. dollar.\n \nUse of estimates:\n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4761, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "797af9e6-f510-4076-89fe-a9370ab00220": {"__data__": {"id_": "797af9e6-f510-4076-89fe-a9370ab00220", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "46a777d9-d534-4fab-8103-d6b5e31466a2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "260ce445356202d7bbd256d92c267f264dbbe63786664fc74df4a70c0da8df69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e733008-95ae-4ecb-8a87-26c83ef8f0e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "91472f441e777b00cb1ebc18ea4e395c6fb2b94c0f3b72e1f666fdc6b52b4bfa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "3M has subsidiaries in Argentina, the operating income of which is less than one half of one percent of 3M\u2019s consolidated operating income for 2018.\nBased on various indices, Argentina\u2019s cumulative three-year inflation rate exceeded 100 percent in the second quarter of 2018, thus being considered highly\ninflationary.

Cost of securities sold use the first in,\nfirst out (FIFO) method. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M\nreviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC 320\n, Investments-Debt and\nEquity Securities\n, when determining the classification of the impairment as \u201ctemporary\u201d or \u201cother-than-temporary\u201d. A temporary impairment charge results\nin an unrealized loss being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders\u2019 equity. Such an unrealized loss does not\nreduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate\nbetween temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the\nunderlying collateral, as well as other factors. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or\n\u201cother-than-temporary\u201d impairment.\n \nInvestments:\n \nAs described in the \u201cNew Accounting Pronouncements\u201d section, 3M adopted ASU No. 2016-01, \nRecognition and Measurement of Financial\nAssets and Financial Liabilities\n, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, all equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for\nunder the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity\ninvestments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price\nchanges in orderly transactions. The balance of these securities is disclosed in Note 7\n.\n \nOther assets: \nOther assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, and\nother long-term assets. Investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any\nchanges in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated\nwith life insurance activity are included in \u201cPurchases of marketable securities and investments\u201d and \u201cProceeds from maturities and sale of marketable\nsecurities and investments,\u201d respectively.\n \nInventories:\n Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation market. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\n \n \nProperty, plant and equipment:\n Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost.\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The\nestimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the range of twenty to forty years. The\nestimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the majority in the range of five to ten years. Fully\ndepreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts\nuntil disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal,\nis charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of\nan asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the\nimpairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value.

The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying\nvalue of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill. The estimated fair\nvalue of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not\n\u201cmore likely than not\u201d less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as \u201cStep 0\u201d. 3M has chosen not to apply Step 0 for its annual goodwill\nassessments.\n \nIntangible assets: \nIntangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an\nindependent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from three to twenty years on a systematic and rational basis\n(generally straight line) that is representative of the asset\u2019s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category, with customer-related largely between ten to\nseventeen years, patents largely between four to thirteen years, other technology-based largely between five to fifteen years, definite lived tradenames\nlargely between three and twenty years, and other intangibles largely between five to thirteen years. Intangible assets are removed from their respective\ngross asset and accumulated amortization accounts when they are no longer in use. Refer to Note 4 for additional details on the gross amount and\naccumulated amortization of the Company\u2019s intangible assets. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as\nincurred, within \u201cResearch, development and related expenses.\u201d\n \nIntangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group)\nmay not be recoverable. \n \nAn impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset\u2019s or\nasset group\u2019s ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of\nthe asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n \nIntangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually,\nand are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be\nimpaired. An impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\n \nRestructuring actions:\n Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs,\nand impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon\ndistributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts\nare estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees were required to\nrender service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable\nemployees and recognized as expense over the employees\u2019 remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to\nterminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will\ncontinue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company.

For the majority of the Company\u2019s customer arrangements, control transfers to\ncustomers at a point-in-time when goods/services have been delivered as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of\ngoods/services transfers to the customer. In limited arrangements, control transfers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the\nbenefits as 3M completes the performance obligation(s).\n \nRevenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled. When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable\nconsideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates,\ntrade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely\namount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes.\nThe range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and\nprojected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across\nbusinesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives.\nThere are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an\nexpense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal\ncourse of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations.

However, the Company\u2019s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors\nits exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as\ncounterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master\nnetting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate\nderivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of\nderivative assets and liabilities within the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master\nnetting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.\n \nFair value measurements:\n 3M follows ASC 820, \nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis.

The Company\u2019s revenue recognition policy under ASC 606 is described earlier in Note 1 and related additional disclosures are included in\nNote 2, Revenue. 3M adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior periods have not been restated. Due to the cumulative\nnet impact of adoption, the January 1, 2018 balance of retained earnings was increased by less than $2 million, primarily relating to the accelerated\nrecognition for software installation service and training revenue.\n \nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, \nRecognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\n, which revises the\naccounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for\nfinancial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The\nnew guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in equity securities and other ownership interests in an entity, including investments in\npartnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies (collectively, equity securities) that do not result in consolidation and are not\naccounted for under the equity method. Entities will need to measure these investments and recognize changes in fair value in net income. Entities will no\nlonger be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities they classify under current guidance as available-for-sale in other\ncomprehensive income (OCI). They also will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily\ndeterminable fair values. Instead, for these types of equity investments that do not otherwise qualify for the net asset value practical expedient, entities will\nbe permitted to elect a practicability exception and measure the investment at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes (in orderly\ntransactions). The ASU also establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value changes of financial\nliabilities for which the fair value option (FVO) has been elected. Under this guidance, an entity would be required to separately present in OCI the portion\nof the total fair value change attributable to instrument-specific credit risk as opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings. This provision does not\napply to derivative instruments required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. For 3M, this standard was\neffective beginning January 1, 2018 via an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings, except for guidance relative to equity\nsecurities without readily determinable fair values which is applied prospectively. The adoption did not have a material impact on 3M\u2019s consolidated results\nof operations and financial condition.\n \nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \nLeases\n, and in July 2018, issued ASU No. 2018-10 and 2018-11 and in December 2018, issued\nASU No. 2018-20, which amended the standard, replacing existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard introduces a lessee model that would\nrequire entities to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases, but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current\naccounting. The ASU does not make fundamental changes to existing lessor accounting. However, it modifies what qualifies as a sales-type and direct\nfinancing lease and related accounting and aligns a number of the underlying principles with those of the new revenue standard, ASU No. 2014-09, such as\nevaluating how collectability should be considered and determining when profit can be recognized. The guidance eliminates existing real estate-specific\nprovisions and requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. For 3M, the ASU is effective January 1, 2019.

As amended, the ASU provides\nfor retrospective transition applied to earliest period presented or an adoption method by which entities would not need to recast the comparative periods\npresented. 3M does not plan on recasting prior periods as it adopts this ASU. 3M has conducted analyses, executed project management relative to the\nprocess of adopting this ASU including implementing a new lease accounting system, conducted detailed contract reviews, considered expanded disclosure\nrequirements, and assessed internal controls impacts. Note 16 provides information regarding rent expense for operating leases and minimum lease\npayments for capital and operating leases under existing lease guidance. While 3M will provide expanded disclosures as a result of ASU No. 2016-02, it\ndoes not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations.

The new standard\nintroduces an approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and modifies the impairment model for\navailable-for-sale debt securities. The new approach to estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\n67", "start_char_idx": 3618, "end_char_idx": 6178, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ea18716-fb90-4d66-9def-789d69df9523": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ea18716-fb90-4d66-9def-789d69df9523", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10ad1db7-1e79-4dae-b3ec-7a38fbd4855c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "212fb7346c0fb4ca3ed6b87a75bb603db8c039fa34f59f44dc1ce5a945d2012b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4739419b-32a3-4466-9705-2e1ddd838a50", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c37573a00c918863e6034e5b7b78d5d3b50327dde71253005a28f1dd099df859", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\n \ncertain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet\ncredit exposures. With respect to available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, the ASU amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model. For such\nsecurities with unrealized losses, entities will still consider if a portion of any impairment is related only to credit losses and therefore recognized as a\nreduction in income. However, rather than also reflecting that credit loss amount as a permanent reduction in cost (amortized cost) basis of that AFS debt\nsecurity, the ASU requires that credit losses be reflected as an allowance. As a result, under certain circumstances, a recovery in value could result in\nprevious allowances, or portions thereof, reversing back into income. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Entities\nare required to apply the standard\u2019s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in\nwhich the guidance is adopted. The Company is currently assessing this ASU\u2019s impact on 3M\u2019s consolidated result of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, \nIntra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory\n, which modifies existing guidance and is\nintended to reduce diversity in practice with respect to the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets. The ASU indicates\nthat the current exception to income tax accounting that requires companies to defer the income tax effects of certain intercompany transactions would\napply only to intercompany inventory transactions. That is, the exception would no longer apply to intercompany sales and transfers of other assets (e.g.,\nintangible assets). Under the existing exception, income tax expense associated with intra-entity profits in an intercompany sale or transfer of assets is\neliminated from earnings. Instead, that cost is deferred and recorded on the balance sheet (e.g., as a prepaid asset) until the assets leave the consolidated\ngroup. Similarly, the entity is prohibited from recognizing deferred tax assets for the increases in tax bases due to the intercompany sale or transfer. For\n3M, the ASU was effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior periods have not been restated and the January 1,\n2018 balance of retained earnings was decreased by less than $2 million.\n \nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, \nClarifying the Definition of a Business\n, which narrows the existing definition of a business and\nprovides a framework for evaluating whether a transaction should be accounted for as an acquisition (or disposal) of assets or a business. The ASU requires\nan entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar\nidentifiable assets; if so, the set of transferred assets and activities (collectively, the set) is not a business. To be considered a business, the set would need\nto include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The standard also narrows the definition of\noutputs. The definition of a business affects areas of accounting such as acquisitions, disposals and goodwill. Under the new guidance, fewer acquired sets\nare expected to be considered businesses. For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2018 on a prospective basis and the Company will apply this guidance\nto applicable transactions after the adoption date.\n \nIn February 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05, \nClarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of\nNonfinancial Assets\n. This ASU addresses scope-related questions that arose after the FASB issued its revenue guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, \nRevenue from\nContracts with Customers\n.

In addition, the guidance also eases certain documentation requirements, modifies the accounting for components excluded from the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness, and requires additional tabular disclosures of derivative and hedge-related information. For 3M, this ASU is effective\nJanuary 1, 2019, with a modified retrospective transition resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings as\nof the adoption date. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on 3M\u2019s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, \nReclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\n, which\npermits entities to reclassify, to retained earnings, the one-time income tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) arising\nfrom the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. An entity that elects to make this reclassification\nmust consider all items in AOCI that have tax effects stranded as a result of the tax rate change, and must disclose the reclassification of these tax effects as\nwell as the entity\u2019s policy for releasing income tax effects from AOCI. The ASU may be applied either retrospectively or as of the beginning of the period\nof adoption. For 3M, this ASU will be adopted effective January 1, 2019 and will result in a reclassification between retained earnings and AOCI. The\nCompany estimates that the impact from this ASU will increase retained earnings by approximately $0.9 billion, with an offsetting increase to accumulated\nother comprehensive loss for the same amount.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, \nImprovements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting\n, which largely aligns the measurement\nand classification guidance for share-based payments to nonemployees with the guidance for share-based payments to employees. The ASU also clarifies\nthat any share-based payment issued to a customer should be evaluated under ASC 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n. The ASU requires a\nmodified retrospective transition approach. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2019. Because the Company does not grant share-based payments\nto nonemployees or customers, this ASU will not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-08, \nClarifying the Scope and the Accounting Guidance for Contributions Received and Contributions Made\n.\nThe ASU applies to entities that receive or make contributions, which primarily are not-for-profit entities but also affects business entities that make\ncontributions. In the context of business entities that make contributions, the FASB clarified that a contribution is conditional if the arrangement includes\nboth a barrier for the recipient to be entitled to the assets transferred and a right of return for the assets transferred (or a right of release of the business\nentity\u2019s obligation to transfer assets). The recognition of contribution expense is deferred for conditional arrangements and is immediate for unconditional\narrangements. The ASU requires modified prospective transition to arrangements that have not been completed as of the effective date or that are entered\ninto after the effective date, but full retrospective application to each period presented is permitted. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2019. The\nCompany does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, \nCodification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases\n, which amends ASU No. 2016-02, \nLeases\n.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4455, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7c5d15c-6b4c-48b4-a9c2-e37550244eae": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7c5d15c-6b4c-48b4-a9c2-e37550244eae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a238231-1dde-42bd-8f73-d62db96a5de9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "bf3c2ee126d9158657a791a714e55a1be20880ca3829c8dc09eca65c5062600c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "13378221-b971-4509-a2f8-b36290bf0b17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "804fc9aef91f57b931de6a338dd404541f86523a1c04cafd81df794d71e8e973", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The recognition of contribution expense is deferred for conditional arrangements and is immediate for unconditional\narrangements.

The\nfederal tax attribute carryovers will expire after 15 to 20 years, the state after 5 to 10 years, and the international after one to three years or have an\nindefinite carryover period. The tax attributes being carried over arise as certain jurisdictions may have tax losses or may have inabilities to utilize certain\nlosses and foreign tax credits without the same type of taxable income. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has provided $67 million of valuation\nallowance against certain of these deferred tax assets based on management\u2019s determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to\nthese assets will not be realized.\n \nReconciliation of Effective Income Tax Rate\n \n \n    \n2018\n    \n2017\n    \n2016\n \nStatutory U.S. tax rate\n \n21.0\n%  \n35.0\n%  \n35.0\n%\nState income taxes - net of federal benefit\n \n1.0\n \n0.8\n \n0.9\n \nInternational income taxes - net\n \n0.2\n \n(6.3)\n \n(2.7)\n \nGlobal Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI)\n \n1.1\n \n \u2014\n \n \u2014\n \nForeign Derived Intangible Income (FDII)\n \n(1.3)\n \n \u2014\n \n \u2014\n \nU.S. TCJA enactment - net impacts\n \n2.5\n \n10.1\n \n \u2014\n \nU.S. research and development credit\n \n(1.5)\n \n(0.7)\n \n(0.5)\n \nReserves for tax contingencies\n \n1.2\n \n2.2\n \n0.2\n \nDomestic Manufacturer\u2019s deduction\n \n \u2014\n \n(1.8)\n \n(1.8)\n \nEmployee share-based payments\n \n(1.4)\n \n(3.2)\n \n(2.8)\n \nAll other - net\n \n0.6\n \n(0.6)\n \n \u2014\n \nEffective worldwide tax rate\n \n23.4\n%  \n35.5\n%  \n28.3\n%\n \nThe effective tax rate for 2018 was 23.4 percent, compared to 35.5 percent in 2017, a decrease of 12.1 percentage points, impacted by several factors.\nPrimary factors that decreased the Company\u2019s effective tax rate included favorable aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) including the decrease in\nthe U.S. income tax rate and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), reduced transitional impact of TCJA related to transition tax and remeasurement of\ndeferred tax assets/liabilities (further discussed below), increased benefits from the R&D tax credit, and favorable adjustment to prior year uncertain tax\nprovisions.

Long-term debt payments due in\n2020 include floating rate notes totaling $95 million (included within long term debt).\n \nCredit Facilities\n \nIn March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year\nrevolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion\n(at lender\u2019s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion.

Under the $3.75\nbillion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This\nis calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on\nall funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2018, this ratio was approximately 25 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\n \nOther Credit Facilities\n \nApart from the committed revolving facility, an additional $243 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and\noutstanding at December 31, 2018.

Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are maintained\nto provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. For its U.S.\npostretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an\nindependent trustee.\n \nThe Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to substantially all regular\nU.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation matched in\ncash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, receive a cash match\nof 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation and receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of\n3% of the participant\u2019s total eligible compensation. All contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees\u2019 elections.\nEmployer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans were $173 million, $159 million and $139 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 3M\nsubsidiaries in various international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined contribution\nplans were $99 million, $88 million and $87 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n \nThe Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07, \nImproving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\n ,\neffective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. This ASU changed how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement\nbenefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. Under the new standard, only the service cost component of net periodic benefit\ncost is included in operating expenses and only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization into assets such as inventory. All other net periodic\nbenefit costs components (such as interest, expected return on plan assets, prior service cost amortization and actuarial gain/loss amortization) are reported\noutside of operating income. See Note 1 for additional details.\n \nThe following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as well as a\nsummary of the related amounts recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective years. 3M also has certain\nnon-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement/excess benefits for employees impacted by\nparticular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and which are not included in the tables that follow. The\nobligations for these plans are included within other liabilities in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet and aggregated less than $40 million as of\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2017.\n91",

retirees in the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans to a savings account benefits-based plan. The contributions\nprovided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for employees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase 1.5\npercent for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore, the Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.\n \nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and postretirement\nbenefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated\nliabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt\ninstruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company\ndetermined a discount rate of 4.36% for the U.S. pension plans and 4.41% for the postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2018, which is an\nincrease of 0.68 percentage points and 0.62 percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2017. An increase in the discount rate\nlowers the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), the significant increase in the discount rate as of December 31, 2018 resulted in an approximately $1.2\nbillion lower PBO for the U.S. pension plans. For the international pension and postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which\nthe associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. If the country has a deep market in corporate bonds the Company matches the\nexpected cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that generate sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve generated from available bond\ninformation.

In countries that do not have a deep market in corporate bonds, government bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate\ncorporate bond yields. \n \nThe Company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs\nare determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-\nspecific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit\nobligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.\n \nFor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company\u2019s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 7.25% in 2018. Projected returns are\nbased primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company\u2019s 2019 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.00%. The expected return assumption is based on\nthe strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management. The\n2018 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 23% global equities, 14% private equities, 47% fixed-income\nsecurities, and 16% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment\nmanagement. The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2018 was -0.5%. In 2017 the plan earned a rate of return of 12.4% and in 2016 earned a return of\n5.8%.

The December 31, 2018 update resulted in a small decrease to the U.S. pension PBO and U.S. accumulated\npostretirement benefit obligations.\n \nDuring 2018, the Company contributed $366 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $4 million to its postretirement plans. During 2017, the\nCompany contributed $964 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans. In 2019, the Company expects to\ncontribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $200 million of cash to its U.S. and international retirement plans. The Company does not have a\nrequired minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2019.

The primary goal of the trust funds is to\nmeet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without\nsubjecting the Company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible\nwithin actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the potential need for additional contributions from 3M. The\ninvestment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S.\npension liabilities.\n \nNormally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds. However, due to\nexternal investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3M securities. The aggregate amount of 3M securities are not\nconsidered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.\n \nThe discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See Note 15 for descriptions of these\nlevels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies\nor assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n95", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3505, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e4658e3-ddf1-4353-9077-b5585a63488b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e4658e3-ddf1-4353-9077-b5585a63488b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d944801-f2cd-40ad-9e86-8c9ed980ae5e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "dbd1d9c5c24892e9a6d32ed5b1c4da0412599c21b23714457455b3715607a5e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e0add56-095d-4654-8884-1ad98f34a27e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2315be5d4ce2c14fcb8184ff816c6868c2dfa2a172a2af8c11a8d7a1237f2541", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\n \nU.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\n \nIn order to achieve the investment objectives in the U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the investment policies include a target\nstrategic asset allocation. The investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and illiquidity of some\ninvestments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long periods of time. Acceptable ranges have\nbeen designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for tactical over- and under-weights. The portfolios will\nnormally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable ranges. The allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary\nof the plans. Approximately 50% of the postretirement benefit plan assets are in a 401(h) account.

Upon issuance of medium-term\nnotes in September 2016, 3M terminated these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial loss within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.\n \nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $200 million as a hedge against\ninterest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt.

Prior to the\nissuance of medium-term notes in October 2017, 3M terminated these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial loss within\naccumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.\n \nDuring 2018, the \nCompany entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $1.2 billion as hedges\nagainst interest rate volatility associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt. Concurrent with the issuance of the medium-term notes in September\n2018, 3M terminated $500 million of these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial gain within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had a balance of $64 million associated with the after tax net unrealized gain associated with cash flow hedging\ninstruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This includes a remaining balance of $7 million (after tax loss) related to forward\nstarting interest rate swaps, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the notes.

To help manage borrowing\ncosts, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference\nbetween fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The mark-to-market of these fair value\nhedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest\nexpense. These fair value hedges are highly effective and, thus, there is no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.\n \nIn November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond due in 2021 for a face amount of 600 million Euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixed-to-floating\ninterest rate swap on a notional amount of 300 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate Eurobond obligation.\n \nIn June 2014, 3M issued $950 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes.

A master netting arrangement\nmay allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 3M has International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements with 17 applicable banks and financial institutions\nwhich contain netting provisions. In addition to a master agreement with 3M supported by a primary counterparty\u2019s parent guarantee, 3M also has\nassociated credit support agreements in place with 16 of its primary derivative counterparties which, among other things, provide the circumstances under\nwhich either party is required to post eligible collateral (when the market value of transactions covered by these agreements exceeds specified thresholds or\nif a counterparty\u2019s credit rating has been downgraded to a predetermined rating). The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these\ncounterparties.\n \n3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when\nderivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the following tables provide\ninformation as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria in\nthe event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of netting arrangements with each of the counterparties. For each counterparty, if netted, the\nCompany would offset the asset and liability balances of all derivatives at the end of the reporting period based on the 3M entity that is a party to the\ntransactions. Derivatives not subject to master netting agreements are not eligible for net presentation. As of the applicable dates presented below, no cash\ncollateral had been received or pledged related to these derivative instruments.\n \nOffsetting of Financial Assets under Master Netting Agreements with Derivative Counterparties\n \n \n \n \n \nGross Amounts not Offset in the\n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n    \nConsolidated Balance Sheet that are Subject\n    \n \n \n \n \n \nGross Amount of\n \nto Master Netting Agreements\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDerivative Assets\n \nGross Amount of\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPresented in the\n \nEligible Offsetting\n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 31, 2018\n \nConsolidated\n \nRecognized\n \nCash Collateral\n \nNet Amount of\n \n(Millions)\n \nBalance Sheet\n \nDerivative Liabilities\n \nReceived\n \nDerivative Assets\n \nDerivatives subject to master netting agreements\n \n$\n146\n \n$\n38\n \n$\n \u2014\n \n$\n108\n \nDerivatives not subject to master netting\nagreements\n \n \n \u2014\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u2014\n \nTotal\n \n$\n146\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$\n108\n \n \nDecember 31, 2017\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDerivatives subject to master netting agreements\n \n$\n78\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n \u2014\n \n$\n51\n \nDerivatives not subject to master netting agreements\n \n \n \u2014\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u2014\n \nTotal\n \n$\n78\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$\n51\n \n \n105", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3670, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ba4a1a4-37ee-4b29-9035-dd334e419f3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ba4a1a4-37ee-4b29-9035-dd334e419f3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9085bfb1-81bb-4930-9fcf-b50a5fb117fa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "9f8ff150665bd167a282e482e31e1be874300c20ffc5cdd6c7881bda01901571", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\n \nOffsetting of Financial Liabilities under Master Netting Agreements with Derivative Counterparties\n \n \n \n \n \nGross Amounts not Offset in the\n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n    \nConsolidated Balance Sheet that are Subject\n    \n \n \n \n \n \nGross Amount of\n \nto Master Netting Agreements\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDerivative Liabilities\n \nGross Amount of\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPresented in the\n \nEligible Offsetting\n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 31, 2018\n \nConsolidated\n \nRecognized\n \nCash Collateral\n \nNet Amount of\n \n(Millions)\n \nBalance Sheet\n \nDerivative Assets\n \nPledged\n \nDerivative Liabilities\n \nDerivatives subject to master netting agreements\n \n$\n53\n \n$\n38\n \n$\n \u2014\n \n$\n15\n \nDerivatives not subject to master netting\nagreements\n \n \n \u2014\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u2014\n \nTotal\n \n$\n53\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$\n15\n \n \nDecember 31, 2017\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDerivatives subject to master netting agreements\n \n$\n197\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n \u2014\n \n$\n170\n \nDerivatives not subject to master netting agreements\n \n \n \u2014\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u2014\n \nTotal\n \n$\n197\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$\n170\n \n \nForeign Currency Effects\n \n3M estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by approximately $92 million\nand approximately $152 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. These estimates include transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments\ndesigned to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.\n \nNOTE 15.  Fair Value Measurements\n \n \n3M follows ASC 820, \nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nand nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in\nmeasuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs\nbe used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained\nfrom sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company\u2019s assumptions about the factors market participants\nwould use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three\nlevels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted\nprices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nCategorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n \nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis:\n \nFor 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities and certain\nderivative instruments. Derivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and net investment hedges. The information in the following paragraphs\nand tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities. Separately, there were no material fair value measurements with\nrespect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company\u2019s financial statements on a recurring basis for 2018\nand 2017.\n \n3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets and liabilities.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n \nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities \u2014 except certain U.S. municipal securities:\n \n106", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4260, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "423eff04-a5cb-4e4f-9169-d390f54f94a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "423eff04-a5cb-4e4f-9169-d390f54f94a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1a5c33e8-98df-40eb-8fce-8b508685f7a2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "d20c081ec909a0f9044c96d7c824b9152df7614942feca42d23343779df8f8c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\n \nMarketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for these securities.\nMarket prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and\nother third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M\nclassifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding certain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2.\nMarketable securities are discussed further in Note 11.\n \nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities \u2014certain U.S. municipal securities only:\n \n3M holds municipal securities with certain cities in the United States as of December 31, 2018.

Refer to Note 9 for\nadditional discussion of the non-cash nature of these securities.\n \nDerivative instruments:\n \nThe Company\u2019s derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, \nDerivatives and Hedging\n, are required to be recorded at fair value. The\nCompany\u2019s derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity price swaps, interest rate swaps,\nand net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use foreign currency denominated debt to\nhedge 3M\u2019s net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820, as the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked\nto a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors that may impact fair value.\n \n3M has determined that foreign currency forwards, commodity price swaps, currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-\ncurrency swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. These inputs include\nforeign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their\nbasis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M\u2019s primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest\nrates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated

The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those\nitems for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M\u2019s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional\ncommitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication of the Company\u2019s expected future cash outflows related to purchases.\n \nWarranties/Guarantees:\n \n3M\u2019s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are estimated at\napproximately $48 million at December 31, 2018, and $50 million at December 31, 2017. Further information on product warranties are not disclosed, as\nthe Company considers the balance immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans\nwith third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.\n \nRelated Party Activity:\n \n3M does not have any material related party activity.\n \nLegal Proceedings:\n \nThe Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory proceedings\nworldwide. These include various products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property,\nand commercial claims and lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust laws, and environmental proceedings. Unless otherwise stated, the\nCompany is vigorously defending all such litigation.\n \nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings\n \nMany lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and whether there are actual damages and are otherwise\nsubject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily\non estimates and assumptions. The Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, \nContingencies\n, and related guidance, and records liabilities for\nlegal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate\nof the probable loss is a range, the Company records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The\nCompany either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot\nbe made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if\nthe Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.\n \nThe Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting\ncomparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has\nconcluded is likely to be recovered. For those insured matters where the Company has taken an accrual, the Company also records receivables for the\namount of insurance that it expects to recover under the Company\u2019s insurance program. For those insured matters where the Company has not taken an\naccrual because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an expense in\ndefending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred.\n \nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the Company may\nnot ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. A future adverse ruling, settlement, unfavorable development, or increase in accruals\nfor one or more of these matters could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows\nin the period in which they are recorded. Although the Company cannot estimate its exposure to all legal proceedings, the Company currently believes that\nthe ultimate outcome of legal proceedings or future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the\nCompany. Based on experience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables\neach period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable.

A minority of the lawsuits and\nclaims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products\npreviously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company\npremises.\n \nThe Company\u2019s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects\nthat filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims\nalleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than\nin the past. Over the past twenty years, the Company has prevailed in fourteen of the fifteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described\nbelow). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict  in its favor in two lawsuits \u2013 one in California state court in February and the other in Massachusetts state court\nin December \u2013 both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs against asbestos fibers. In April 2018, a jury\nin state court in Kentucky found 3M\u2019s 8710 respirators failed to protect two coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory damages of\napproximately $2 million and punitive damages totaling $63 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company has appealed. The\nCompany believes liability in this case is not probable and estimable. In June 2018, the Company also settled a number of coal mine dust lawsuits for an\namount that was not material to the Company.\n \nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended\nmanner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if\nsignificant, are attributable to the Company\u2019s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless the Company\u2019s litigation experience indicates that claims of\npersons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of\nunimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it\nexperienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.\n \nAs previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two other\nmanufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. The amended\ncomplaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for worker\u2019s\ncompensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. The case was inactive\nfrom the fourth quarter of 2007 until late 2013, other than a case management conference in March 2011. In November 2013, the State filed a motion to\nbifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damages proceedings. At the hearing on the motion, the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit.

These\nactivities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. As the database of studies of both\nPFOA and PFOS has expanded, the EPA has developed human health effects documents summarizing the available data from these studies. In\nFebruary 2014, the EPA initiated external peer review of its draft human health effects documents for PFOA and PFOS. The peer review panel met in\nAugust 2014. In May 2016, the EPA announced lifetime health advisory levels for PFOA and PFOS at 70 parts per trillion (ppt) (superseding the\nprovisional levels established by the EPA in 2009 of 400 ppt for PFOA and 200 ppt for PFOS).

Through January 2017, the EPA reported results for 4,920 public water supplies nationwide.\nBased on the 2016 lifetime health advisory, 13 public water supplies exceed the level for PFOA and 46 exceed the level for PFOS (unchanged from the July\n2016 EPA summary). A technical advisory issued by EPA in September 2016 on laboratory analysis of drinking water samples stated that 65 public water\nsupplies had exceeded the combined level for PFOA and PFOS. These results are based on one or more samples collected during the period 2012-2015 and\ndo not necessarily reflect current conditions of these public water supplies. EPA reporting does not identify the sources of the PFOA and PFOS in the public\nwater supplies. EPA has announced a forthcoming management plan.\n \nThe Company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to address its historic disposal of PFAS-containing waste\nassociated with manufacturing operations at the Decatur, Alabama, Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and Cordova, Illinois plants. As previously reported, the\nCompany entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) to address the\npresence of PFAS in the soil at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama. Pursuant to a permit issued by ADEM, for approximately\ntwenty years, the Company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge containing PFAS in fields at its Decatur facility. After a review of the\navailable options to address the presence of PFAS in the soil, ADEM agreed that the preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former\nsludge incorporation areas on the manufacturing site with subsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment. Implementation of that plan continues,\nand construction of the cap was substantially completed in 2018.\n \nThe Company continues to work with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed May 2007\nSettlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFAS in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington\nCounty, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4087, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23fbfee7-c5ec-48ed-b0ab-378d8cb2d9d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "23fbfee7-c5ec-48ed-b0ab-378d8cb2d9d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ae130210-5726-418a-ac83-9f192f4d278b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "cf0327112925a6cefd80be3664b37e8466ab53751a5f1efa576bceef6a426f11", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2419d99a-5baf-4c90-b9c5-0cc045a30a4d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "fd4c55ce284e0392b8299b843842fb34575d67f6c96f75b7aa8bdc846af004d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Pursuant to a permit issued by ADEM, for approximately\ntwenty years, the Company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge containing PFAS in fields at its Decatur facility.

The new HBVs are 35 ppt for PFOA and 27 ppt for PFOS. In connection with its\nannouncement the MDH stated that \u201cDrinking water with PFOA and PFOS, even at the levels above the updated values, does not represent an immediate\nhealth risk. These values are designed to reduce long-term health risks across the population and are based on multiple safety factors to protect the most\nvulnerable citizens, which makes them overprotective for most of the residents in our state.\u201d In December 2017, the MDH issued a new HBV for\nperfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) of 2 ppb. In February 2018, the MDH published reports finding no unusual rates of certain cancers or adverse birth\noutcomes (low birth rates or premature births) among residents of Washington and Dakota counties in Minnesota.\n \nThe EPA announced a four-step action plan in May 2018 regarding PFAS, which includes evaluating the need to set Safe Drinking Water Act maximum\ncontaminant levels (MCLs) for PFOA and PFOS and beginning the steps necessary to designate PFOA and PFOS as \u201chazardous substances\u201d under\nCERCLA. In November 2018, EPA asked for public comment on draft toxicity assessments for two PFAS compounds, including PFBS.\n \nThe U.S.\n \nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) within the Department of Health and Human Services released a draft Toxicological\nProfile for PFAS for public review and comment in June 2018. In the draft report, ATSDR proposed draft Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) for PFOS, PFOA\nand several other PFAS. An MRL is an estimate of the daily human exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of\nadverse non-cancer health effects over a specified duration of exposure. MRLs are  not intended to define cleanup or action levels for ATSDR or other\nagencies. In August 2018, 3M submitted comments on the ATSDR proposal, noting that there are major shortcomings with the current draft, especially with\nthe MRLs, and that the ATSDR\u2019s profile must reflect the best science and full weight of evidence known about these chemicals.\n \nIn several states, the state legislature or the state environmental agency have been evaluating or have taken actions related to cleanup standards,\ngroundwater values or drinking water values for PFOS, PFOA, and other PFAS.\n \nThe Company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions arising from the foregoing proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken regarding such\ncompounds or the consequences of any such actions.\n \nLitigation Related to Historical PFAS Manufacturing Operations in Alabama\n \nAs previously reported, a former employee filed a putative class action lawsuit in 2002 in the Circuit Court of Morgan County, Alabama (the \u201cSt. John\ncase\u201d), seeking unstated damages and alleging that the plaintiffs suffered fear, increased risk, subclinical injuries, and property damage from exposure to\ncertain perfluorochemicals at or near the Company\u2019s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility.

In May 2010, consistent with its handling of the other matters, the Morgan County Circuit Court\nabated this case, putting it on hold pending the resolution of the class certification issues in the St. John case.\n \nIn October 2015, West Morgan-East Lawrence Water & Sewer Authority (Water Authority) filed an individual complaint against 3M Company, Dyneon,\nL.L.C, and Daikin America, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The complaint also includes representative plaintiffs who\nbrought the complaint on behalf of themselves, and a class of all owners and possessors of property who use water provided by the Water Authority and five\nlocal water works to which the Water Authority supplies water (collectively, the \u201cWater Utilities\u201d). The complaint seeks compensatory and punitive\ndamages and injunctive relief based on allegations that the defendants\u2019 chemicals, including PFOA and PFOS from their manufacturing processes in\nDecatur, have contaminated the water in the Tennessee River at the water intake, and that the chemicals cannot be removed by the water treatment\nprocesses utilized by the Water Authority. In September 2016, the court granted 3M\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 trespass claims with prejudice,\nnegligence claims for personal injuries, and private nuisance claims, and denied the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claims for property damage,\npublic nuisance, abatement of nuisance, battery and wantonness.\n \nIn June 2016, the Tennessee Riverkeeper, Inc.

The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in connection with the disposal of certain PFAS\nthrough their ownership and operation of their respective sites. The complaint further alleges such practices may present an imminent and substantial\nendangerment to health and/or the environment and that Riverkeeper has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm caused by defendants\u2019 failure\nto abate the endangerment unless the court grants the requested relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief.\n \nIn August 2016, a group of over 200 plaintiffs filed a putative class action against West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water\nAuthority), 3M, Dyneon, Daikin, BFI, and the City of Decatur in state court in Lawrence County, Alabama. Plaintiffs are residents of Lawrence, Morgan\nand other counties who are or have been customers of the Water Authority. They contend defendants have released PFAS that contaminate the Tennessee\nRiver and, in turn, their drinking water, causing damage to their health and properties. In January 2017, the court in the St. John case, discussed above,\nstayed this litigation pending resolution of the St. John case.\n \nIn January 2017, several hundred plaintiffs sued 3M, its subsidiary Dyneon, and Daikin America in Lawrence and Morgan Counties, Alabama. The\nplaintiffs are owners of property, residents, and holders of property interests who receive their water from the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and\nSewer Authority (Water Authority). They assert common law claims for negligence, nuisance, trespass, wantonness, and battery, and they seek injunctive\nrelief and punitive damages.

The plaintiff, Occidental Chemical Corporation, alleges that it agreed to\ndesign and pay the estimated $165 million cost to remove and cap sediment containing eight chemicals of concern, including PCBs and dioxins. The\ncomplaint seeks to spread those costs among the defendants, including the Company.

Whether, and to what extent, the Company may be required to contribute to the costs at issue in the\ncase remains to be determined.\n \nFor environmental litigation matters described above, no liability has been recorded as the Company believes liability in those matters is not probable and\nestimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time.\n \nEnvironmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had recorded liabilities of $25 million for estimated \u201cenvironmental remediation\u201d costs based upon an evaluation\nof currently available facts with respect to each individual site and also recorded related insurance receivables of $8 million. The Company records\nliabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of\nfeasibility studies or the Company\u2019s commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are\nbased primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other\npotentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions.

The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the\napplicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years.\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had recorded liabilities of $59 million for \u201cother environmental liabilities\u201d based upon an evaluation of currently\navailable facts to implement the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order with the MPCA (including the best estimate of the probable liability under the\nsettlement of the NRD Lawsuit for interim treatment of municipal and private wells), the remedial action agreement with ADEM, as well as presence in the\nsoil and groundwater at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities in Decatur, Alabama, and Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and at two former disposal sites in\nWashington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury).

The DOL has stated its investigation relates to certain private equity\ninvestments, plan expenses, securities lending, and distributions of plan benefits. In response to certain DOL requests, 3M produced documents and made\nemployees available for interviews. In December 2016, the DOL issued certain subpoenas to 3M and 3M Investment Management Corp. relating to this\ninvestigation. 3M has produced additional responsive documents and is cooperating with the DOL in its investigation. In June 2018, the DOL issued a\nletter indicating that it did not intend to take further action.\n \nProduct Liability Litigation\n \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company is a named defendant in lawsuits involving approximately 5,015 plaintiffs (compared to approximately 4,270\nplaintiffs at December 31, 2017) who allege the Bair Hugger\u2122 patient warming system caused a surgical site infection. Nearly all of the lawsuits are\npending in federal court in Minnesota. The plaintiffs claim they underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later\ndeveloped surgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger\u2122 patient warming system (the Bair Hugger\u2122 product line was acquired by 3M as part\nof the 2010 acquisition of Arizant, Inc., a leading manufacturer of patient warming solutions designed to prevent hypothermia and maintain normal body\ntemperature in surgical settings). The complaints seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and\nimplied warranties, failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and\nviolations of various state consumer fraud, deceptive or unlawful trade practices and/or false advertising acts. One case, from the U.S. District Court for the\nWestern District of Tennessee is a putative nationwide class action. The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion\nto transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota to be managed in a multi-district\nproceeding during the pre-trial phase of the litigation. In 2017, the U.S. District Court and the Minnesota state courts denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motions to\namend their complaints to add claims for punitive damages. At a joint hearing before the U.S. District Court and the Minnesota State court, on the parties\u2019\nmotion to exclude each other\u2019s experts, and 3M\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to general causation, the federal court did not exclude the\nplaintiffs\u2019 experts and denied 3M\u2019s motion for summary judgment on general causation. In January 2018, the state court, in hearing the same arguments,\nexcluded plaintiffs\u2019 experts and granted 3M\u2019s motion for summary judgment on general causation, dismissing all 61 cases pending before the state court in\nMinnesota. Plaintiffs appealed that ruling and the state court\u2019s punitive damages ruling. In January 2019, the Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the\nMinnesota state court orders in their entirety. The plaintiffs have indicated that they intend to seek review by the Minnesota Supreme Court.\n \nIn April 2018, the federal court partially granted 3M\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the first bellwether case, leaving for trial a claim for strict liability\nbased upon design defect. The court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claims for negligence, failure to warn, and common law and statutory fraud. In the trial of the\nfirst bellwether case in May 2018, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in 3M\u2019s favor finding that the Bair Hugger\u2122 patient warming system was not\ndefective and was not the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury.

The settlement is subject to the court\u2019s approval and certification of the settlement class, with a right of class\nmembers to opt-out of the settlement and bring individual claims against the Company.\n \nIn December 2018, a military veteran filed an individual lawsuit against 3M in the San Bernardino Superior Court in California alleging that he sustained\npersonal injuries while serving in the military caused by 3M\u2019s Dual-Ended Combat Arms earplugs \u2013 Version 2, a product no longer sold by the Company or\nits subsidiary Aearo Technologies. The plaintiff asserts claims of product liability and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment. The plaintiff seeks\nvarious damages, including medical and related expenses, loss of income, and punitive damages. In 2019, approximately 26 other lawsuits have been filed\nagainst 3M by former or current military personnel in various state and federal courts in California, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Louisiana, Missouri, Texas,\nFlorida, and the District of Columbia making similar allegations.\n \nFor product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the Company believes the amount recorded is not\nmaterial to the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range\nof loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.\n \n \nNOTE 17.  Stock-Based Compensation\n \n \nThe 3M 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the issuance or delivery of up to 123,965,000 shares of 3M common stock pursuant to awards granted\nunder the plan. Awards may be issued in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, progressive stock options, stock appreciation\nrights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and performance shares. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining\nshares available for grant under the LTIP Program are 26.3 million and there were approximately 7,700 participants with outstanding options, restricted\nstock, or restricted stock units.\n \nThe Company\u2019s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February to provide a strong and immediate link between the performance of\nindividuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants. The grant to eligible employees uses the closing stock price on\nthe grant date. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense\nrecognition when an employee is eligible to retire. Employees are considered eligible to retire at age 55 and after having completed ten years of service.\nThis retiree-eligible population represents 38 percent of the annual stock-based compensation award expense dollars; therefore, higher stock-based\ncompensation expense is recognized in the first quarter.\n \nIn addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants.

Expansion of these initiatives, which previously had been deployed only in the\nU.S., reduces the complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3M businesses. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual\ncredit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides\ncustomer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country. The expansion of alignment of customer accounts within\nadditional countries increased the attribution of dual credit across 3M\u2019s business segments. Additionally, certain sales and operating income\nresults for electronic bonding product lines that were previously equally divided between the Electronics and Energy business segment and the\nIndustrial business segment are now reported similarly to dual credit. As a result, previously reported aggregate business segment net sales and\noperating income for total year 2017 increased $1.568 billion and $402 million, respectively, offset by similar increases in the elimination of dual\ncredit net sales and operating income amounts.\n \nCentralization of manufacturing and supply technology platforms\n\u00b7\nCertain shared film manufacturing and supply technology platform resources formerly reflected within the Electronics and Energy business\nsegment were combined with other shared and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise within Corporate and Unallocated. This\nchange resulted in a decrease in previously reported net sales and an increase in operating income for total year 2017 of $1 million and $42\nmillion, respectively, in the Electronics and Energy segment, offset by a corresponding increase in net sales and decrease in operating income\nwithin Corporate and Unallocated.\n \nIn addition, as discussed in Note 1, 3M adopted ASU N0. 2017-07, \nImproving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic\nPostretirement Benefit Cost\n, effective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. As a result, operating income for 3M\u2019s business segments has been revised\nto reflect non-service cost related pension and postretirement net periodic benefit costs within other expense (income),

The offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled \u201cElimination of Dual Credit,\u201d such that sales and\noperating income in total are unchanged.\n126", "start_char_idx": 2479, "end_char_idx": 3928, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c2b8bf0-3c8e-436d-9323-aa91cc4854a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c2b8bf0-3c8e-436d-9323-aa91cc4854a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b61fd043-eeef-475e-ae39-8fe5ed886aa5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "79b84887626d43824e99b05033f2aada2631ac4cb19dbaf2c918bb7abe7281fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b1ffc42f-8de7-4a80-afc8-9fe5db9ceeab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8d64eb5ac07c5a52d2fd150d0b3d99daa8275a5150a206c5eafbb8461a548ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\n \n \nNOTE 19.

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures\u201d (as defined in the Exchange\nAct Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\n \nb. The Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in\nthe Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the\nframework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in \nInternal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013).\nBased on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is effective. The\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered\npublic accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.\n \nc. There was no change in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company\u2019s most recently completed fiscal\nquarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\n \nThe Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain\nfinancial and related transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The implementation of a\nworldwide ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.\n \nThe Company completed implementation with respect to various processes/sub-processes in certain subsidiaries/locations, including aspects relative to the\nUnited States, and will continue to roll out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new information technology application we implement,\nthis application, along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the testing for\neffectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. We concluded, as part of its evaluation described in the above paragraphs, that the\nimplementation of the ERP system in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial reporting.\n \nItem 9B. \nOther Informatio\n \nn.\n \nNone.\n \n128", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3231, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e763f76-3650-42e3-a64a-c3ec0939bae4": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e763f76-3650-42e3-a64a-c3ec0939bae4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "885359d2-67ab-41a3-a9b1-a1685ab16af0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "0fc189d5786f5505018db67ed993fde9830b2a2b2c84697f7895bfac97ef4d6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\n \nPART II\n \nI\n \n \nDocuments Incorporated by Reference\n \nIn response to Part III, Items 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, parts of the Company\u2019s definitive proxy statement (to be filed pursuant to Regulation 14A within 120\ndays after Registrant\u2019s fiscal year-end of December 31, 2018) for its annual meeting to be held on May 14, 2019, are incorporated by reference in this\nForm 10-K.\n \nItem 10. \nDirector\n \ns, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\n \nThe information relating to directors and nominees of 3M is set forth under the caption \u201cProposal No. 1\u201d in 3M\u2019s proxy statement for its annual meeting of\nstockholders to be held on May 14, 2019 (\u201c3M Proxy Statement\u201d) and is incorporated by reference herein.

This program will\nbe called the \u201c3M Compensation Plan for Nonemployee Directors\u201d (the \u201cPlan\u201d).  This amendment and restatement of the Plan is\neffective January 1, 2019 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d). \n1.2.\n \nComponents of Compensation\n.  Each nonemployee member of the Board (each, a \u201cNonemployee Director\u201d)\nwill be eligible to receive a base annual retainer, one or more additional annual retainers for service as chair of one or more Board\ncommittees, an additional annual retainer for service as the lead independent director, and other fees.  All retainers and other fees\nprovided to the Nonemployee Directors will be paid at such times, in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions set forth\nin this Plan and as the Board may determine to be appropriate, subject to any limitations set forth from time to time in the 3M\nCompany 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan or any successor thereto (the \u201cLTIP\u201d).\nFor purposes of the Plan, the term \u201cAnnual Stock Retainer\u201d refers to the portion of the retainers and other fees that the Board\ndetermines will be paid only in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (\u201cShares\u201d), deferred stock units (\u201cDSUs\u201d) or a combination of\nShares and DSUs and the term \u201cAnnual Cash Retainer\u201d refers to all other retainers and fees.\n1.3.\n \nConversion of Amounts to Shares/DSUs\n.  Unless otherwise specified by the Board or set forth herein, the\nnumber of Shares or DSUs to be issued, transferred or credited on any given date in respect of a cash-based amount will be\ndetermined by dividing (a) such amount (as converted into U.S. dollars, if necessary, on such basis as may reasonably be determined\nby the Company in its discretion) by (b) the closing sales price (rounded to the nearest cent) for a Share as quoted on the New York\nStock Exchange for the last trading day immediately preceding the initial payment date determined in accordance with the terms of\nthe Plan (i.e., without regard to any delay for administrative convenience), rounded up to the nearest thousandth of a share or DSU, as\napplicable. \n1.4.\n \nVesting; Restrictions\n.  Except as set forth in Section 3.5, as required by applicable law or as otherwise specified\nby the Board, (i) DSUs awarded in accordance with the terms of the Plan as payment for services rendered as a Nonemployee\nDirector will be fully vested, and (ii) Shares issued or transferred in accordance with the terms of the Plan as payment for services\nrendered as a Nonemployee Director will be fully vested and unrestricted Shares.\n1.5.\n \nAdministration\n.  The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) of the\nBoard.  The Committee has the authority to take all actions and make all determinations under the Plan, to interpret the Plan and to\nadopt, amend and repeal Plan administrative rules, guidelines and practices as it deems advisable.  The Committee may correct\ndefects and ambiguities, supply omissions, reconcile inconsistencies in the Plan and make all other determinations that that it deems\nnecessary or appropriate to administer the Plan.  The Committee\u2019s determinations under the Plan are in its sole discretion and will be\nfinal and binding on all persons having or claiming any interest in the Plan or any award.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3541, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "080373ff-d74e-406f-9fa6-66a59a023bb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "080373ff-d74e-406f-9fa6-66a59a023bb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6161eefb-f25d-4088-91a5-5a5c1b65d109", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2018_10K/3M_2018_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1252586, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "ae63272f97e02d9437b0b1bfd1042c192a4ca89bd22322afc040d0a03ce15ec9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ARTICLE 2\n \nANNUAL CASH RETAINER\n2.1.\n \nGeneral\n.

A Nonemployee Director may revoke an election prior to the\nbeginning of the calendar year for which it applies.

Unless the\nterms of the payment election provide otherwise, the Nonemployee Director will have the right to revoke an election made under this\nSection 4.1(b) until the end of the last day permitted for making such an election.  Such Nonemployee Director\u2019s ability to elect\nalternative forms and time of payment under this Plan for succeeding years will be on the same basis as for other Nonemployee\nDirectors.\n4.2.\n \nDuration of Payment Elections\n.\n(a)\n \nGeneral Rule\n.

An election under Section 4.1(b) above will remain in effect for the portion \nof the\ncalendar year remaining after the election becomes effective and irrevocable\n.\n4.3.\n \nDeferred Cash\n.  For each Nonemployee Director who receives all or a portion of his or her Annual Cash\nRetainer in the form of Deferred Cash, 3M will establish a memorandum account and will credit such memorandum account for\namounts of Deferred Cash earned. Such   \namounts will be credited as of the date(s) on which they otherwise would be paid in cash\npursuant to Section 2.3 absent a deferral election.
