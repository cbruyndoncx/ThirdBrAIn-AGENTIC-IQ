      Assess whether {COMPANY} is capital-intensive according to {PERIOD} fiscal period data

      Capital-intensive businesses tend to have one or several of the following characteristics:

      - high `(Net) Fixed Assets, a.k.a. (Net) Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E)` as proportion of `Total Assets`,
        e.g., over 25%;

      - high `Total Assets` relative to `(Total) (Net) (Operating) Revenue(s), a.k.a. (Total) (Net) Sales`,
        e.g., over 2 times;

      - high `Capital Expenditure(s), a.k.a. CapEx, or Capital Spending, or Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E) Expenditure(s)/Purchase(s)`
        relative to `(Total) (Net) (Operating) Revenue(s), a.k.a. (Total) (Net) Sales`,
        e.g., over 10%;

        and/or

      - low `Return on (Total) Assets, a.k.a. RoA or RoTA`,
        e.g., under 10%,
        according to formula:

        `Return on (Total) Assets, a.k.a. RoA or RoTA` = (
          `Net Income, a.k.a. Net Profit, or Net Earnings (or Loss(es)) (Attributable to Shareholders)` /
          `average Total Assets, typically between two consecutive fiscal year-ends`
        )
