The Company experienced raw material\nprice inflation and constrained supply throughout the global marketplace and continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact. To help manage disruption in its\nmanufacturing operations, 3M deployed careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and qualification of additional\nsupply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. In addition, 3M evaluates suppliers\u2019 conformance\nwith environmental and social compliance requirements.

The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. The\nCompany\u2019s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents or trade secrets. Patents applicable to specific products\nextend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is\nobtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of\nlegal remedies in the country.\nThe Company believes that its trademarks, patents, and trade secrets provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or group\nof related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company\u2019s business segments.\nGovernment Regulation and Environmental Law Compliance\nThe Company\u2019s business operations are subject to various governmental regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including, among others, those related to product liability;\nantitrust; intellectual property; environmental, health, and safety; tax; the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, international import and export\nrequirements and trade sanctions compliance; regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies, U.S. federal healthcare program-\nrelated laws and regulations, such as the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws and the Sunshine Act.\n3M\u2019s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws and regulations around the world. The Company places consistent emphasis on\nenvironmental responsibility. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 3M is also involved in\nremediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to \u201cEnvironmental Matters and Litigation\u201d in Note 16, Commitments and\nContingencies).\nEnvironmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities for\nanticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility\nstudies, the Company\u2019s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future\noperations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nIn 2022, 3M expended approximately $317 million on capital projects for environmental purposes as defined below. Capital projects for environmental purposes include waste\nreduction and pollution control programs such as, water usage reduction and water quality improvement equipment, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units\nand thermal oxidizers. Capital expenditures for similar projects are presently expected to approach approximately $646 million for 2023 and 2024 in aggregate.\nAlthough an estimate of certain nearer-term capital expenditures is provided above, 3M cannot predict with certainty whether future costs of compliance with government\nregulations (including environmental regulations) will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\n7", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3690, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c5f9124-b50c-44aa-8e92-8315ec69d9b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c5f9124-b50c-44aa-8e92-8315ec69d9b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e8210225-977f-4f0d-a12e-be8353532040", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "d49dcf2b6ec79a369d497334524155edfda36a5d02b81df89f8d9daa2f816c84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "136f610f-78ad-4f34-b199-ec035bc3bd60", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "2deb8e4d2c40e51bc72e1e801480cb65638525be5545cfdc75fb0ba214e7844e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b14e606b-49d9-4d07-86a1-a1929c93b1df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a02c20cc513853e2316cf93dbe55c0f62a9d8aacd3d4e56436ac7d84425c064a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "T\nable of \nContents\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nFollowing is a list of the executive officers of 3M, and their age, present position, the year elected to their present position and other positions they have held during the past\nfive years.

Discussion of these factors is incorporated by\nreference into and considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks Related to the Global Economy and Public Health Crises\n* The Company\u2019s results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade, geopolitical, and other external\nconditions.\nThe Company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States, and, accordingly, the Company\u2019s\noperations and the execution of its business strategies and plans are subject to global competition and economic and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control, such as,\namong other things, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns, military conflicts, public health emergencies such as COVID-19, political changes and trends such as\nprotectionism, economic nationalism resulting in government actions impacting international trade agreements or imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory\ncounter measures, and government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in locations or industries in which the Company operates. Further escalation of specific trade\ntensions, including those between the U.S. and China, or more broadly in global trade conflict, could adversely impact the Company's business and operations around the world.\nThe Company's business is also impacted by social, political, and labor conditions in locations in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate; adverse changes in\nthe availability and cost of capital; monetary policy; interest rates; inflation; recession; commodity prices; currency volatility or exchange control; ability to expatriate earnings;\nand other laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate. For example, changes in local economic condition or outlooks,\nsuch as lower economic growth rates in China, Europe, or other key markets, impact the demand or profitability of the Company's products.\nThe global economy has been impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. and other governments have imposed export controls on certain products\nand financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. 3M suspended operations of its subsidiaries in Russia in March 2022 and, in September\n2022, committed to a plan to exit the related net assets through an intended sale of the subsidiaries. 3M also has other operations that source certain raw materials from\nsuppliers in Russia and has experienced related supply disruption due to the conflict. These geopolitical tensions could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, further\nsupply chain disruptions impacting downstream customers, higher energy costs, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of\nwhich may adversely affect the Company's business and supply chain.\nClimate change, as well as related environmental and social regulations, may negatively impact the Company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of\nnatural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we or our suppliers\nor customers operate.\n* Unexpected events, such as those related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) public health crisis, may increase the Company's cost of doing business and disrupt the Company's\noperations.\n3M, as a global company, is impacted by unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), civil unrest, natural\ndisasters, and severe weather in the locations in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate, and these events have adversely affected, and could in the future\nadversely affect, the Company's operations and financial performance. For example, the global pandemic associated with COVID-19, including related evolving governmental\nresponses to the pandemic, has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and has impacted and will continue to impact 3M\u2019s operations, including its supply\nchain and its manufacturing and distribution capabilities. Although COVID-19 increased demand for certain 3M products, it also resulted in decreased demand from certain end\nmarkets, made it more difficult for 3M to serve customers, and resulted in conditions that had the potential to damage 3M's reputation, including third-party price gouging,\ncounterfeiting, and other illegal or fraudulent activities involving 3M's products. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of\naffected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5174, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8664dd8c-4561-4b29-87a3-96446fa563fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "8664dd8c-4561-4b29-87a3-96446fa563fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bff17e0e-509e-41d0-8de5-cdc860feef5a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "d009db44869585f33fecc5def3afabe118f5816efbaecd8ae4c1a3601ddae37c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd711f9e-12e9-4390-8119-e4035da7b251", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "0e95530f0f2d4cf57756861fe4eef558a401268c282c62c53dbc25fc0914f5ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bbbdd0a0-e44d-4fc1-916c-a7eec35fc4d8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a6af5bd74e09cfcc8f9defed3857704dfaa0df26526549403ca329454f5c669", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "For example, the global pandemic associated with COVID-19, including related evolving governmental\nresponses to the pandemic, has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and has impacted and will continue to impact 3M\u2019s operations, including its supply\nchain and its manufacturing and distribution capabilities.

For a discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Company, see Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\n* \nThe Company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results.\nAs previously reported, governments in the United States and internationally have increasingly been regulating a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances\nproduced by the Company, collectively known as \u201cPFAS.\u201d 3M has noticed several global regulatory trends related to PFAS, including declining emission standards and limits\nset as to the presence of certain compounds in various media, and the inclusion of a broadening group of PFAS. Developments in these and other global regulatory trends may\nrequire additional actions by 3M, including investigation, remediation, and compliance, or may result in additional litigation and enforcement action costs.\nThe Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in\ntheir review of the environmental and health effects of certain PFAS produced by the Company.\nThe PFAS group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical, and fire resistance, as\nwell as electrical insulating properties. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. These characteristics have made PFAS\nsubstances critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets, and semi-conductors. They are also used to help prevent contamination of medical\nproducts like surgical gowns and drapes. Commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on PFAS technology. PFAS compounds are manufactured by various\ncompanies, including 3M, and are used in everyday products, including some manufactured by 3M. As science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving\nknowledge and the understanding that certain PFAS compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3M announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production\nof two PFAS substances, perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) globally as a precautionary measure. We phased out of materials used to produce\ncertain repellants and surfactant products, with most of these activities in the U.S. completed by the end of 2002. Phased out products included Aqueous Film Forming Foam\n(AFFF) and certain coatings for food packaging, for example. The Company continues to review, control, or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as\nintended substances in products, or as byproducts of some of 3M\u2019s current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\n3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025; and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product\nportfolio by the end of 2025. 3M\u2019s decision is based on careful consideration and a thorough evaluation of the evolving external landscape, including multiple factors such as\naccelerating regulatory trends focused on reducing or eliminating the presence of PFAS in the environment and changing stakeholder expectations.

Additionally, the Company collects\nand stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy\nand cybersecurity laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls.

The\nCompany\u2019s increased adoption of remote working, initially driven by the pandemic, also introduces additional threats and risk of disruptions to our information technology\nnetworks and infrastructure.

There can be no assurance that we will realize the benefits\nof such activities, or that such activities will not result in unexpected consequences, such as a reduced ability to generate sales or provide the experience that our customers,\nsuppliers, vendors, and channel partners expect from us. In addition, the ability to adapt to business model and other changes, including responding to evolving customer needs\nand service expectations, are important, and, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to win new business and enhance revenue and 3M\u2019s brand.\nOperational challenges, including those related to customer service, pace of change and productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, financial conditions and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Financial and Capital Markets and Tax Matters\n* The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.\nThe performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in market interest rates,\ndecreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the\nCompany's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\n* Change in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.\nThe Company\u2019s credit ratings are important to 3M\u2019s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company\u2019s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M.\nThis evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of\nfinancial reporting. As of December 2022, 3M has a credit rating of A1, stable outlook from Moody's Investors Service, and a credit rating of A+, CreditWatch negative from\nS&P Global Ratings. The Company\u2019s credit ratings have served to lower 3M\u2019s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to\nthe Company\u2019s capital structure could impact 3M\u2019s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company\u2019s cost\nof funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n* Changes in tax rates, laws, or regulations could adversely impact our financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to tax-related external conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws and regulations, changing political environments in the U.S. and foreign\njurisdictions that impact tax examination, and assessment and enforcement approaches. In addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from\nU.S. or international tax reform legislation could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In connection with the Base\nErosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Integrated Framework provided by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), determination of multi-jurisdictional\ntaxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change. Due to the evolving nature of global tax laws and regulations and\ncompliance approaches, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements, but these actions could have an adverse impact on\nthe Company's financial results.\n15", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4306, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "109fcf65-5da6-4fff-8a0d-69ccf0b023d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "109fcf65-5da6-4fff-8a0d-69ccf0b023d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fabd295-0bee-422e-9c2b-942fb559ad47", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "4d1fedc1ee30b8603fc62716f5dc242af31f09d1b2e22404f1ab96367459d70a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e8390d0-8dd6-4673-811b-d7cebf44e144", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "5a4b2ee72dc80efea6f27188aa77dc089333f1fb77097d4311029d8ba38378b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0837d7fc-a52f-44c8-bcff-2bad97208da5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9f337bd3e1f2676cc6c940bb342c90633cd96b1058199b6d33f0d281831465f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "T\nable of \nContents\nRisks Related to the Voluntary Chapter 11 Proceedings Initiated by the Company\u2019s Aearo Entities\n* The Company is subject to risks related to its subsidiaries\u2019 chapter 11 proceedings.\nOn July 26, 2022, Aearo Technologies and certain of its related entities (\u201cAearo Entities\"), all wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, voluntarily initiated chapter 11\nproceedings seeking bankruptcy court supervision to establish a trust \u2013 funded by the Company \u2013 to address potential liabilities related to Dual-Ended Combat Arms \u2013 Version\n2 earplugs and mask/respirator products historically manufactured and sold by Aearo Entities. This represents a change in strategy for managing the Combat Arms Version 2\nearplugs and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities. Aearo Entities were acquired by the Company in 2008 and they, along with its related subsidiaries,\nhave operated as Company subsidiaries since that time. 3M has entered into a funding agreement with Aearo Entities and committed to fund a trust to satisfy all claims\ndetermined to be entitled to compensation, and to support Aearo Entities as they continue to operate during the chapter 11 proceedings. There are a number of risks and\nuncertainties associated with the chapter 11 proceedings, including, among others, those related to: legal risks related to the chapter 11 proceedings; potential impacts to the\nCompany\u2019s reputation and relationships with its customers, suppliers, federal contracting officials, employees, regulators, and other counterparties and community members;\nimpacts to the Company\u2019s liquidity or results of operations, including risks related to the amount that will be necessary to fully and finally resolve all of the Company\u2019s\nobligations to make payments to resolve such claims under the terms of its funding and indemnification agreement with Aearo Entities; the costs of chapter 11 proceedings and\nlength of time necessary to resolve the cases; and Aearo Entities\u2019 ability to reach acceptable agreements with claimants and navigate the chapter 11 proceedings to obtain\napproval and consummation of a plan of reorganization. Due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot predict the timing, outcome, or financial impact of\nthis matter, or any other ongoing or future litigation.\nRisks Related to the Planned Spin-off of the Company\u2019s Health Care Business\n* The Company is subject to risks related to its plan to spin off its Health Care business\n.\nOn July 26, 2022, the Company announced its intent to spin off its Health Care business, resulting in two standalone public companies, in a transaction that is intended to be\ntax-free for the Company\u2019s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The spin-off will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including final approval\nby the Company\u2019s board of directors, the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and\na tax opinion from external counsel, and other customary conditions. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions, many of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control,\ncould delay the completion of the spin-off relative to the anticipated timeline or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in the completion of the spin-off or any change to the\nanticipated terms of the transaction could reduce the expected benefits of the transaction, or delay the time at which such benefits are realized. There can also be no assurance\nthat the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized if the spin-off is completed, or that the costs or dis-synergies of the transaction (including costs of related\nrestructuring transactions), will not exceed the anticipated amounts. Whether or not the spin-off is ultimately completed, the pendency of the transaction may impose challenges\non the Company and its business, including potential business disruption; the diversion of management time on matters relating to the transaction; the impact on the Company\u2019s\nability to retain talent; and potential impacts on the Company\u2019s relationships with its customers, employees, regulators, and other counterparties. In addition, while it is intended\nthat the transaction would be tax-free to the Company\u2019s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there is no assurance that the transactions will qualify for this\ntreatment. If the spin-off was ultimately determined to be taxable, the Company, the Health Care business, or the Company\u2019s stockholders could incur income tax liabilities that\ncould be significant. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock.\nItem 1B.\n \nUnresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4832, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0837d7fc-a52f-44c8-bcff-2bad97208da5": {"__data__": {"id_": "0837d7fc-a52f-44c8-bcff-2bad97208da5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fabd295-0bee-422e-9c2b-942fb559ad47", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "4d1fedc1ee30b8603fc62716f5dc242af31f09d1b2e22404f1ab96367459d70a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "109fcf65-5da6-4fff-8a0d-69ccf0b023d0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "09b632235b451363e891492e99155f83804fa85ee468ec13199c4e7a852b4620", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a6c4cbe5-c41c-4b0d-82f8-81ac2ce7e176", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "637657daa011b0f1443f7184e3b5e93ed9fd5c5bc5f9fc6c3cb7217e2380e339", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In addition, while it is intended\nthat the transaction would be tax-free to the Company\u2019s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there is no assurance that the transactions will qualify for this\ntreatment.

Effective in the first quarter of 2022, 3M made the\nfollowing changes:\n\u2022\nChanges in measure of segment operating performance used by 3M\u2019s chief operating decision maker\u2014impacting 3M\u2019s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss\n(business segment operating income). See additional information in Note 19. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of the changes in\nsegment reporting. See additional information in Note 2.\n\u2022\nChanges to non-GAAP measures - certain amounts adjusted for special items. Refer to the \nCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures)\n section\nbelow for additional information.\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\n3M manages its operations in four operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. From a geographic\nperspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. References are made to organic sales change (which include both organic\nvolume impacts and selling price impacts), which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions,\nnet of divestitures. Acquisition and divestiture sales change impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction. 3M believes this information is\nuseful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\n3M is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19). Risk factors with respect to COVID-19 can be found in Item 1A \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d in this document. Given the diversity of 3M\u2019s businesses, some of the factors relative to COVID-19 increase the demand for 3M products, while others decrease\ndemand or make it more difficult for 3M to serve customers. Certain resulting impacts are referenced in various discussions within this Item 7. Overall, the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on 3M\u2019s consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply\nchains. 3M is not able to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nIn 2022, 3M's costs for significant litigation (see \nCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures\n section below) totaled approximately $2.3 billion pre-tax\nand included, among things, pre-tax charges associated with steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation and associated with additional commitments to address\nPFAS-related matters at its Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (approximately $1.3 billion and $355 million, respectively, in 2022). These matters are further discussed in Note 16. In\n2022, 3M also completed the split-off of its Food Safety Division business resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion and committed to a plan to exit PFAS manufacturing by the\nend of 2025 resulting in a 2022 pre-tax charge of \n$0.8 billion related to impairment as discussed in Note 15.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4568, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c295c1bc-ee5d-4e24-a099-b82daad1985a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c295c1bc-ee5d-4e24-a099-b82daad1985a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a4295413-0b93-4019-a7b1-b7267b6ea176", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "591111657881faa748c5afc03ed8bb0e449faeae19655f5358eda8884201d11e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "687f6aac-fb99-4fee-841d-7e3643660011", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "c439d06aaad7438bd04f2025ce8d55d62b42f0d9037067613e1337420f08df23", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d6839d7-fa5b-47b4-99bf-3bc7183394f1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "415fcc41fd26da9ac9f780c90caa85293f930d5f1a7c5690a34b23795d0ef316", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In 2022, 3M's costs for significant litigation (see \nCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures\n section below) totaled approximately $2.3 billion pre-tax\nand included, among things, pre-tax charges associated with steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation and associated with additional commitments to address\nPFAS-related matters at its Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (approximately $1.3 billion and $355 million, respectively, in 2022).

As discussed in Note 16, 3M\nBelgium received agreement with authorities in June 2022 to begin the process toward restarting operations at the Zwijndrecht facility. 3M Belgium has provided information\nrequired by the Flemish environmental authorities to receive agreement from the authorities to restart operations, and has done so for production or sampling purposes. Belgian\ngovernment authorities continue to maintain oversight of these operations and compliance with applicable requirements. In December 2022, 3M Belgium received an official\ninfraction report from the Flemish Environmental Inspectorate and continues to work with the government authorities to comply with applicable legal requirements. See further\ndiscussion in Note 16.\n3M is also impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In light of a number of factors, 3M suspended operations of its subsidiaries in Russia in March 2022, the net sales of which\nwere less than one percent of 3M\u2019s consolidated net sales for 2021. Further, in September 2022, management committed to a plan to exit and dispose of the related net assets\nthrough an intended sale of the subsidiaries. The associated charge in 2022 related to this action is further discussed in Note 15. 3M also has other operations that source certain\nraw materials from suppliers in Russia and have experienced related supply disruption due to the conflict.

Overall, the effective tax rates for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 9.6 percent, 17.8 percent, and\n19.7 percent, respectively. These reflect a decrease of 8.2 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and a decrease of 1.9 percentage points from 2020 to 2021. The primary\nfactors that decreased the Company's effective tax rate for 2022 were the tax efficient structure associated with the gain on split-off of the Food Safety business (see Note\n3). The primary factors that decreased the Company's effective tax rate in 2021 were geographical income mix and favorable adjustments in 2021 related to impacts of\nU.S. international tax provisions.\n\u2022\nOn an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rates for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 17.7 percent, 18.1 percent, and 20.5 percent, respectively.

For the periods\npresented, special items include the items described below. Operating income, segment operating income (loss), income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and the\neffective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and a measure adjusted for special items. The adjusted measures are not in accordance\nwith, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. While the Company includes certain items in its measure of segment operating performance, it also considers these non-\nGAAP measures in evaluating and managing its operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for special items is useful to investors in understanding\nunderlying business performance, while also providing additional transparency to the special items. Special items impacting operating income are reflected in Corporate and\nUnallocated, except as described below with respect to net costs for significant litigation and PFAS manufacturing exit costs. The determination of these items may not be\ncomparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company changed the extent of matters and charges/benefits it includes within special items with respect to net costs for significant litigation.\nPreviously, 3M included net costs, when significant, associated with changes in accrued liabilities related to respirator mask/asbestos litigation and PFAS-related other\nenvironmental matters, along with the associated tax impacts. These non-GAAP measure changes involved including net costs for litigation related to 3M\u2019s Combat Arms\nEarplugs, expanding net costs to include external legal fees and insurance recoveries associated with the applicable matters in addition to changes in accrued liabilities, and to\ninclude all such net costs for the applicable matters, not just when considered significant. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods\npresented.\nSpecial items for the periods presented include:\nNet costs for significant litigation:\n\u2022\nThese relate to 3M's respirator mask/asbestos, PFAS-related other environmental, and Combat Arms Earplugs matters (as discussed in Note 16). Net costs include the\nimpacts of any changes in accrued liabilities, external legal fees, and insurance recoveries, along with associated tax impacts.

In the Asia Pacific geographic area, China total sales increased 17\npercent which included increased organic sales of 11 percent. In Japan, total sales were flat which included increased organic sales of 2 percent.\nManaging currency risks:\nThe stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on sales in full year 2022 compared to the same periods last year. Net of the Company\u2019s hedging strategy, foreign currency\nnegatively impacted earnings in full year 2022 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk related to earnings including natural\nhedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In\nthe case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid\ncurrencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging\ntools as discussed above. In either case, 3M\u2019s hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for\n3M\u2019s businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\nFinancial condition:\nRefer to the section entitled \u201cFinancial Condition and Liquidity\u201d later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nIn November 2018, 3M\u2019s Board of Directors replaced the Company\u2019s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the\nrepurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M\u2019s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2022, the Company purchased $1.5 billion of its own stock, compared\nto $2.2 billion of stock purchases in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the authorization. In February 2023, 3M\u2019s Board of\nDirectors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M.\nRaw materials:\nRefer to the section entitled \u201cRaw materials\u201d in Item 1 for discussion of 3M's sources and availability of raw materials in 2022.\nPension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:\nOn a worldwide basis, 3M\u2019s pension and postretirement plans were 96 percent funded at year-end 2022. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 70\npercent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 97 percent funded and the international pension plans were 116 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not\nfunded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2022 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were -17.4 percent, as 3M strategically invests in both\ngrowth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status.

Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the\nproducts or components sold by 3M\u2019s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas.

Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in\nthe section entitled \u201cCash Flows from Investing Activities.\u201d\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements\nin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions are subject\nto inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\nThe Company considers the items below to be critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or\nresults of operations of the Company. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee\nof 3M\u2019s Board of Directors.\nLegal Proceedings:\nAssessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain, and can rely heavily on\nestimates and assumptions. The Company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with\nAccounting Standard Codification (ASC) 450, \nContingencies\n. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal\nProceedings\u201d (contained in \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Note 16) for additional information about such estimates.\nPension and Postretirement Obligations:\nThe Company applies certain estimates for the discount rates and expected return on plan assets in determining its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations and\nrelated net periodic benefit costs. The below further describes these estimates.

The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting\nthese cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows\nsufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each\ncorresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by\napplying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit\nobligations as the change in service and interest costs offset the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. Changes in expected benefit payment and\nservice cost cash flows, as well as ongoing changes in market activity and yields, cause these rates to be subject to uncertainty.\nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\nU.S. Qualified Pension\nInternational Pension (weighted\naverage)\nU.S. Postretirement Medical\nDecember 31, 2022 Liability:\nBenefit obligation\n5.18 \n%\n4.39 \n%\n5.13 \n%\n2023 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:\nService cost\n5.27 \n%\n4.06 \n%\n5.26 \n%\nInterest cost\n5.11 \n%\n4.39 \n%\n5.05 \n%\nExpected return on plan assets\nThe expected return on plan assets for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and\nexpected performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2023 is\n7.50%, an increase from 6.00% in 2022. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis\nusing plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plans is 4.61% for 2023\ncompared to 3.86% for 2022. Changes in asset allocation and market performance over time, among other factors, cause these estimates to be subject to uncertainty.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $426 million and a\nbenefit of $248 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total\nconsolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $178 million, down from $206 million in 2021.\nIn 2023, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $270 million while non-service pension and postretirement net\nbenefit costs is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $125 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of approximately\n$145 million, a decrease of approximately $30 million compared to 2022.\nAssessments of Goodwill:\nThe Company makes certain estimates and judgments in impairment assessments of goodwill. As of December 31, 2022, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $12.8 billion.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate\nthe carrying amount may be impaired.

Reporting units are one level below the business segment level,\nbut are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did\nnot combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets exceeds the\nestimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using\ncomparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples. 3M also performs a discounted cash flow analysis\nfor certain reporting units where the market approach indicates additional review is warranted. A discounted cash flow analysis involves key assumptions including projected\nsales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rates. Changes in reporting unit earnings, comparable company information, and expected future cash flows, as well\nas underlying market and overall economic conditions, among other factors, make these estimates subject to uncertainty.\nBased on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2022 completed as of October 1, 2022, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. As of October 1,\n2022, 3M had 21 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 94 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the\nfollowing divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and\nTapes, Medical Solutions, Oral Care, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification Sciences, and Transportation Safety.\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M\u2019s businesses could not\neasily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M\u2019s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M\u2019s value being comprised of internally developed businesses.\nFollowing the annual impairment test, as a result of 3M's December 2022 announced commitment to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing as\ndescribed in Notes 4 and 15, 3M tested the Advanced Materials and Electronics Materials Solutions reporting units (within the Transportation and Electronics business) for\nimpairment resulting in a goodwill impairment charge related to the Advanced Materials reporting unit.\n3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2023 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\nAssessments of Long-Lived Assets:\nThe Company makes certain estimates and judgments in impairment assessments of long-lived assets. As discussed in Note 1, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment\nwhen events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the\ncarrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition. The amount of the\nimpairment is based on the excess of the asset group\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. As discussed in Notes 4 and 15, in December 2022, as a result of 3M's commitment to a\nplan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing, 3M recorded a charge related to impairment of long-lived assets. Underlying fair values were determined\nprimarily using discounted cash flow models. Key assumptions included projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rates.

The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and\ncircumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company\u2019s\ncurrent estimate of the tax liabilities.

If\npayment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when\nthe Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n36", "start_char_idx": 3749, "end_char_idx": 5963, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "411716af-8077-4b11-aa23-fd161d34b0b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "411716af-8077-4b11-aa23-fd161d34b0b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f35a29a-0a1d-473e-a692-4650513caf71", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "7ac57e2777a738aa797f7863e7117b4d3cb73d40f62e47f44ac5e3f9d60937c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8d8f14f-651a-4c34-9175-57241b598564", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "b63a32c4bd16b63d5409a035bc74c52100be9ab26d6faa1ee3341bdad52db452", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4f224e09-a97c-48f6-9369-ca641686fa40", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e799b1d641f7da2ec28cafdaca7c6dae7049d1ef20c3ac93bce92c04ba0666a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "T\nable of \nContents\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nThe strength and stability of 3M\u2019s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provide financial flexibility to deploy\ncapital in accordance with the Company's stated priorities and meet needs associated with contractual commitments and other obligations. Investing in 3M\u2019s business to drive\norganic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and\ncommercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M\nexpects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow\nfrom U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those\ninternational earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10\nfor further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Company\u2019s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it\nwill have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M\u2019s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a\nmaximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nTotal debt:\nThe strength of 3M\u2019s credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company\u2019s debt maturity profile is\nstaggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. As of December 2022, 3M has a credit rating of A1, stable\noutlook from Moody's Investors Service, and a credit rating of A+, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings.\nThe Company\u2019s total debt was lower at December 31, 2022 when compared to December 31, 2021. Decreases in debt were largely due to the repayments of 500 million euros\nand $600 million aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate medium-term notes in February 2022 and June 2022, respectively. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds\nfrom debt refer to the following \u201cCash Flows from Financing Activities\u201d section.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate\n(\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBOR\u2019s administrator, proposed extending the publication of USD LIBOR through\nJune 2023. Subsequently, in March of 2021, IBA ceased publication of certain LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021. USD LIBOR rates that did not cease on December 31,\n2021 will continue to be published through June 30, 2023. The Company has reviewed its debt securities, bank facilities, derivative instruments, and commercial contracts that\nmay utilize LIBOR as the reference rate.

The\nCompany manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these\narrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon\nnotional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements.\nRefer to Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk\nand value at risk analysis.\nItem 7A.\n \nQuantitative\n \nand Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nIn the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity\nprices. Changes in those factors could impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Senior management provides oversight for risk management and\nderivative activities, determines certain of the Company\u2019s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior\nmanagement also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the\nCompany\u2019s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits,\nand by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\nForeign Exchange Rates Risk:\nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows\nrelated to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign exchange\nforward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash\nflow hedges. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time over which 3M\nhedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency contracts that are not\ndesignated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany\nfinancing balances. As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to\nhedge portions of the Company\u2019s net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s foreign exchange forward and option\ncontracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $3.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company\u2019s\nforeign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was $2.8 billion at December 31, 2022.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken\nas a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nthey relate.\nLegal Proceedings\nAs described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, management records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the\namount of the loss and when the loss is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, management records as an accrual in its financial statements the\nmost likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. Management either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess\nof established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. Management discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or\nthe amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if management believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to legal proceedings is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management\nwhen assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when estimating the loss or range of loss for each claim, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment,\nsubjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s assessment of the liabilities and disclosures associated with legal proceedings.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s evaluation of the liability related to legal proceedings, including controls over\ndetermining the likelihood of a loss and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included,\namong others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel, obtaining and evaluating contracts and agreements, evaluating the\nreasonableness of management\u2019s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable, and evaluating the\nsufficiency of the Company\u2019s disclosures related to legal proceedings.\nTax-free Determination of the Split-Off of the Food Safety Division\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the split-off of the Food Safety Division business in a transaction that involved a\nReverse Morris Trust structure. \nManagement has determined that the Food Safety Division split-off involving the Reverse Morris Trust structure and certain internal business\nseparation transactions (the split-off and certain internal business separation transactions referred to together as the \u201cTransactions\u201d) qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. In making these determinations, management applied U.S. federal tax law to relevant facts and circumstances and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from\nthe Internal Revenue Service, third party tax opinions, and other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. \nThe applicable facts and circumstances that existed\nat the time of the Transactions may be reviewed as part of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service. If the completed Transactions were later determined to fail to qualify for\ntax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the tax-free determination of the Transactions is a critical audit matter are (i) the\nsignificant judgment by management in applying relevant tax laws and regulations in determining the Transactions qualify as tax-free, and (ii) the significant impact to the\nfinancial statements if these tax-free determinations were determined to be inappropriate by the relevant taxing authorities. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment,\nsubjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the tax-free determination of the Transactions. In addition, the audit effort involved\nthe use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s determination of the tax-free treatment of the Transactions.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5559, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad3e2559-3fc0-4184-96fb-96af5312e4c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad3e2559-3fc0-4184-96fb-96af5312e4c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b944d7bc-548f-4383-976d-68df36f94c13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "8705c7222246941e959d9eab0ef94211bd24ecb73c16e2cf0c90378eb66d7ceb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5777993-d6c0-45df-858f-4b6a0d6beaf1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "ef1c19c720a3e46b4d79ba2fde0ae12bb0e184a69a61f68f32d1be1446629f33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ebd85ac-681b-400f-b96a-e4a8bf47a0f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2239ad454f78b3392c1ca8ec0085a9d857b7946827ac4c8226d1c4d4be9bdd34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the tax-free determination of the Transactions is a critical audit matter are (i) the\nsignificant judgment by management in applying relevant tax laws and regulations in determining the Transactions qualify as tax-free, and (ii) the significant impact to the\nfinancial statements if these tax-free determinations were determined to be inappropriate by the relevant taxing authorities.

Management tests property, plant and\nequipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss\nis recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual\ndisposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. Management also tests goodwill for\nimpairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and tests for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the\ncarrying amount may be impaired. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value,\nnot to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill. In December 2022, the Company committed to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS)\nmanufacturing by the end of 2025. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, related to the impairment of long-lived\nassets ($0.5 billion - primarily associated with property, plant and equipment) and impairment of goodwill ($0.3 billion) for the Advanced Materials Division. Underlying fair\nvalues were determined primarily using discounted cash flow models based on assumptions of projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, discount rate and other\napplicable items.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the property, plant and equipment and goodwill impairment assessments for the\nAdvanced Materials Division is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials\nDivision asset group and reporting unit, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence\nrelating to the appropriateness of management\u2019s discounted cash flow models and reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA\nmargins, capital expenditures, and discount rate and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s property, plant and equipment and goodwill impairment assessments for the Advanced\nMaterials Division, including controls over management\u2019s identification of events or changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment of an asset group or reporting unit\nhas occurred and controls over the determination of the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit. These procedures also included,\namong others, testing management\u2019s process for determining the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit, evaluating the\nappropriateness of the discounted cash flow models, and evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins,\ncapital expenditures, and discount rate. Evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins, and capital expenditures involved evaluating\nwhether the assumptions used were reasonable considering the current and past performance of the Advanced Materials Division, external market and industry data, evidence\nobtained in other areas of the audit and the Company\u2019s objectives and strategies. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the\nappropriateness of the discounted cash flow models and evaluating the reasonableness of the discount

"T\nable of \nContents\n3M Company and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 1. \nSignificant Accounting Policies\nConsolidation:\n 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All applicable subsidiaries are consolidated. All\nintercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term \u201c3M\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\n3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities in the third quarter of 2022.\n See additional information in Note 16.\nBasis of presentation:\n Certain amounts in the prior years\u2019 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2022, 3M made changes in the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M\u2019s chief operating decision maker\u2014impacting 3M\u2019s\ndisclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income). See additional information in Note 19. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated\nas a result of the changes in segment reporting. See additional information in Note 2. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\nForeign currency translation:\n Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States. Exceptions include 3M\u2019s subsidiaries in Argentina\nand, beginning in the second quarter of 2022, in Turkey, the economy of which also became highly inflationary. The operating income and balances of underlying net monetary\nassets denominated in Turkish lira are not material to 3M. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are remeasured as if their functional currency is that of their parent.\nAssets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at\naverage monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) in shareholders\u2019 equity.\nUse of estimates:\n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company considered the coronavirus (COVID-19) related impacts on its estimates, as appropriate,\nwithin its consolidated financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods. 3M believes that the accounting estimates are appropriate after giving\nconsideration to the increased uncertainties surrounding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent\nuncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents:\n Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.\nMarketable securities:\n Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value. Cost of securities sold use the first in, first out (FIFO)\nmethod. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M reviews impairments associated with\nits marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC 320, Investments-Debt Securities and ASC 326-30, Available-for-Sale Debt Securities,\nwhen determining whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is\nrecorded through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. A change in the allowance for\ncredit losses is recorded into earnings in the period of the change. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through\naccumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders\u2019 equity. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to\nwhich fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. When a credit\nloss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what\nallowance amount, if any, should be recorded.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4874, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25c34daa-f9ac-4353-8291-9264ed5c7e56": {"__data__": {"id_": "25c34daa-f9ac-4353-8291-9264ed5c7e56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7b77a80b-6087-4780-824d-808516d35d0d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "f996cba37ddd125d7884e7e36e88319921c10ee687f666537126132e0e8b30e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc316fb1-2762-4ca3-8181-0c2c5699f5f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "8c807ed3e8bed0308222be0edc30869083a959ec208fccdb3ed6c6c03e588dcb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7fe461ee-b064-44fc-adc2-0191f106caf9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef6c38a688503101bb3ed3f1a84e1b1176fdecd873f59f1285d9a13430e18d67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "An impairment relating to credit losses is\nrecorded through an allowance for credit losses.

Investments in life insurance\npolicies are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period\naccounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life insurance activity are included in \u201cPurchases of marketable securities and\ninvestments\u201d and \u201cProceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments,\u201d respectively.\nInventories:\n Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less\nreasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\nProperty, plant and equipment:\n Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property,\nplant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and\nimprovements primarily range from \nten\n to \nforty years\n, with the majority in the range of \ntwenty\n to \nforty years\n. The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily\nrange from \nthree\n to \nfifteen years\n, with the majority in the range of \nfive\n to \nten years\n. Fully depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in\nproperty, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts\nand the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an\nasset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded\nis calculated by the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M records capital-related\ngovernment grants earned as reductions to the cost of property, plant and equipment; and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash\nchanges in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.\nConditional asset retirement obligations:\n A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived\nassets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the\nCompany. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value\nand the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $\n177\n million and $\n176\n millions\nat December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGoodwill:\n Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not\namortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances\nchange that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.

Goodwill is not\namortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances\nchange that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting\nunit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic\ncharacteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the\nreporting unit\u2019s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is\ndetermined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples or, in\nsome cases, based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not\n\u201cmore likely than not\u201d less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as \u201cStep 0\u201d. 3M has chosen not to apply Step 0 for its annual goodwill assessments.\nIntangible assets:\n Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party.\nIntangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from \nsix\n to \ntwenty years\n on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative\nof the asset\u2019s use.

An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s ongoing use and\neventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. Fair\nvalue is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\nIntangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the third quarter of\neach year, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. An\nimpairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nRestructuring actions:\n Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairment or\naccelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and\nsubstantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management\napproves the associated actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees in certain circumstances are required to render service in order to receive benefits at their\ntermination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees\u2019 remaining service\nperiods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company\nprovided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company.\nRevenue (sales) recognition:\n The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk or\nsignificant payment terms extended to customers. The vast majority of 3M\u2019s customer arrangements contain a single performance obligation to transfer manufactured goods as\nthe promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct. However, to a limited extent 3M also\nenters into customer arrangements that involve intellectual property out-licensing, multiple performance obligations (such as equipment, installation and service), software with\ncoterminous post-contract support, services and non-standard terms and conditions.\nThe Company recognizes revenue in light of the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with\n \nCustomers\n. Revenue is recognized\nwhen control of goods has transferred to customers. For the majority of the Company\u2019s customer arrangements, control transfers to customers at a point-in-time when\ngoods/services have been delivered as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of goods/services transfer to the customer. In limited\narrangements, control transfers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as 3M completes the performance obligation(s).\nRevenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled. When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable consideration applying\nthe portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts.\nThese sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is\nbased on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the\nfollowing inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the\nsales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or\ngrowth objectives. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an\nexpense and recorded in cost of sales.

Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the\nuse of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market\nparticipants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that\nreflect the Company\u2019s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the\ncircumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs\ninclude quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other\nthan quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization\nwithin the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nAcquisitions:\n The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, \nBusiness Combinations\n. This standard requires the acquiring entity in a business\ncombination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective\nfor all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date\nfair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from\nacquisition accounting. In addition to business combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain enterprises that\ndo not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. These transactions are largely reflected as additional asset purchase and investment activity.\nLeases:\n 3M determines if an arrangement is a lease upon inception. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a\nperiod of time in exchange for consideration. The right to control the use of an asset includes the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the underlying asset\nand the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used. 3M determines certain service agreements that contain the right to use an underlying asset are not leases\nbecause 3M does not control how and for what purpose the identified asset is used. Examples of such agreements include master supply agreements, product processing\nagreements, warehouse and distribution services agreements, power purchase agreements, and transportation purchase agreements.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used\nto calculate present value is 3M\u2019s incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. 3M determines the incremental borrowing rate for leases using a\nportfolio approach based primarily on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.\nAs a lessee, the Company leases distribution centers, office space, land, and equipment. Certain 3M lease agreements include rental payments adjusted annually based on\nchanges in an inflation index. 3M\u2019s leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired businesses and synergies expected\nto arise after 3M\u2019s acquisition of these businesses.\n2022 acquisitions:\nThere were \nno\n acquisitions that closed during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n2021 acquisitions:\nThere were \nno\n acquisitions that closed during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n2020 acquisitions:\nThere were \nno\n acquisitions that closed during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDivestitures:\n3M may divest certain businesses from time to time based upon review of the Company\u2019s portfolio considering, among other items, factors relative to the extent of strategic and\ntechnological alignment and optimization of capital deployment, in addition to considering if selling the businesses results in the greatest value creation for the Company and for\nshareholders. As discussed in Note 19 (Business Segments), gains/losses on business divestitures are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated.\n2022 divestitures and previously announced divestitures:\nIn March 2022, 3M completed the sale of its floor products business in Western Europe, formerly part of the Consumer business, for immaterial proceeds that approximated the\nbusiness's book value.\nIn July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company. 3M expects to initially retain an ownership position of \n19.9\n% in the\nbusiness, which 3M intends to monetize over time. The Company expects to complete the transaction, which is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, by\nyear-end 2023. The transaction is subject to customary conditions, including final approval from the 3M Board of Directors, regulatory approvals and rulings, and satisfactory\ncompletion of financing, among other items. Because the intended transaction is a spin-off, the Health Care business is not classified as held for sale.\nIn September 2022, 3M completed the split-off and combination of its Food Safety Division business (formerly part of the Health Care business segment) with Neogen\nCorporation in a transaction that involved a Reverse Morris Trust structure intended to make the split-off tax-efficient to 3M and 3M's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. As a result of the transaction, 3M reflected a \npre-tax gain\n of $\n2.7\n billion based on aggregate consideration of $\n2.8\n billion. Under the terms of the underlying\nagreements, aggregate consideration included 3M shares exchanged and $\n1.0\n billion ($\n828\n million after closing and other adjustments) funded from debt that became\nobligations of Neogen. The cash and non-cash consideration components are further described below.\n\u2022\n$\n2.0\n billion representing the value of \n16\n million 3M common shares accepted by 3M that reduced shares outstanding through a fully-subscribed exchange offer.

The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. The net UTB is\nincluded as components of Other Assets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the consolidated statement of income\non a gross basis approximately $\n1\n million of expense, $\n14\n million of expense, and $\n21\n million of expense in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The amount of interest and\npenalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or remeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, accrued\ninterest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $\n116\n million and $\n140\n million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts are\ninterest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.\nAs a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain foreign operations in the following countries is subject to reduced\ntax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: China (2022), Switzerland (2026), Brazil (2029) \nand Singapore (2032). The income tax benefits\nattributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $\n170\n million (\n30\n cents\n per diluted share) in 2022, $\n204\n million (\n36\n cents per diluted share) in 2021, and\n$\n163\n million (\n28\n cents per diluted share) in 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately $\n16.0\n billion of undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. Approximately $\n8.0\n billion of these earnings are\nno longer considered permanently reinvested. The incremental tax cost to repatriate these earnings to the US is immaterial. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on\napproximately $\n8.0\n billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022 which are indefinitely reinvested in operations. Because of the\nmultiple avenues by which to repatriate the earnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income\ntax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.\nNOTE 11. \nMarketable Securities\nThe Company invests in asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities. \nThe following is a summary of amounts recorded\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet for marketable securities (current and non-current).\n(Millions)\n2022\n2021\nCommercial paper\n$\n213\n \n$\n109\n \nCertificates of deposit/time deposits\n21\n \n14\n \nU.S. treasury securities\n\u2014\n \n75\n \nU.S. municipal securities\n4\n \n3\n \nCurrent marketable securities\n238\n \n201\n \nU.S. municipal securities\n23\n \n27\n \nNon-current marketable securities\n23\n \n27\n \nTotal marketable securities\n$\n261\n \n$\n228\n \nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, gross unrealized, gross realized, and net realized gains and/or losses (pre-tax) were not material.\nThe balances at December 31, 2022 for marketable securities by contractual maturity are shown below.

debt for the periods subsequent to December 31, 2022 are\nas follows (in millions):\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\nAfter

floating rate notes totaling $\n149\n million (classified as\ncurrent portion of long-term debt).\nCredit Facilities\n3M has an amended and restated $\n3.0\n billion \nfive\n year revolving credit facility expiring in November 2024. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which\n3M may request an increase of up to $\n1.0\n billion (at lender\u2019s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $\n4.0\n billion. In addition, 3M entered into a $\n1.25\n billion \n364\n-day credit\nfacility, which was renewed in November 2022 with an expiration date of November 2023. The \n364\n-day credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may convert any\nadvances outstanding on the maturity date into term loans having a maturity date one year later. These credit facilities were undrawn at December 31, 2022. Under both the $\n3.0\nbillion and $\n1.25\n billion credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than \n3.0\n to 1. This is\ncalculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the \nfour\n consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the\nsame period. At December 31, 2022, this ratio was approximately \n19\n to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\nIn December 2021 and June 2022, 3M entered into debt financing facilities providing commitments for term loans and potential bridge financing aggregating $\n1.0\n billion\nrelated to the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen (discussed in Note 3). The debt commitments also included a $\n150\n million revolving\ncredit facility for the Food Safety business. Coincident with completion of the September 2022 split-off, the Food Safety business term loan borrowings funded the cash\npayment to 3M discussed in Note 3.

These swaps converted $\n500\n million and\n$\n300\n million of 3M\u2019s $\n1\n billion and $\n650\n million principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms\nthrough mid-2028 with an interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index.\nIn March 2020, 3M issued $\n1.75\n billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate registered notes.

This charge reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to reacquire the notes and\nrelated expenses.\nIn December 2020, 3M, via make-whole-call offers, repaid $\n1\n billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included $\n400\n million aggregate principal\namount of \n3.00\n% notes and $\n600\n million aggregate principal amount of \n1.625\n% notes, both of which were due to mature in 2021.

The contributions provided by the\nCompany to the health savings accounts increase \n3\n percent per year for employees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase \n1.5\n% for employees who retire on or after\nJanuary 1, 2016. Therefore, the Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.\nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and postretirement benefit plans, which is\nalso the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the\nend of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing\nand amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of \n5.18\n% for the U.S. pension plans and \n5.25\n% for the\npostretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2022, which is an increase of \n2.29\n percentage points and an increase \n2.37\n percentage points, respectively, from the rates used\nas of December 31, 2021. An increase in the discount rate decreases the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), the increase in the discount rate as of December 31, 2022 resulted\nin an approximately $\n4.5\n billion lower benefit obligation for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans.\nThe Company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined\nbased on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-\nyear projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset\nin the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.\nFor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company\u2019s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was \n6.00\n% in 2022. Projected returns are based primarily on\nbroad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December 31, 2022, the\nCompany\u2019s 2023 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is \n7.50\n%. The expected return assumption is based on the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term\ncapital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management. The 2022 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation\nassumption of \n10\n% global equities, \n14\n% private equities, \n60\n% fixed-income securities, and \n16\n% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance\nbenchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment management.

The primary goal of the trust funds is to meet the obligations\nas required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without subjecting the Company to an undue amount of\ncontribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined\nasset limits, thus reducing the potential need for additional contributions from 3M. The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to\noffset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities.\nNormally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds. However, due to external investment\nmanagement of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3M securities. The aggregate amount of 3M securities are not considered to be material relative to the\naggregate fund percentages.\nThe discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See Note 15 for descriptions of these levels. While the\ncompany believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair\nvalue of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nU.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\nIn order to achieve the investment objectives in the U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the investment policies include a target strategic asset allocation.\nThe investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and illiquidity of some investments may cause the allocation to a specific\nasset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long periods of time. Acceptable ranges have been designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to\nallow for the opportunity for tactical over- and under-weights. The portfolios will normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable ranges.\nThe allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary of the plans. Approximately \n72\n% of the postretirement benefit plan assets are in a 401(h) account. The 401(h)\naccount assets are in the same trust as the primary U.S. pension plan and invested with the same investment objectives as the primary U.S. pension plan.\n82", "start_char_idx": 0,

However, the\nCompany\u2019s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits,\nand by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate\ncredit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result\nof multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions\nare subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the following tables provide information as if the Company had elected to\noffset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria in the event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of\nnetting arrangements with each of the counterparties. For each counterparty, if netted, the Company would offset the asset and liability balances of all derivatives at the end of\nthe reporting period based on the 3M entity that is a party to the transactions. Derivatives not subject to master netting agreements are not eligible for net presentation.\n91", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3161, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42b3b96d-5fc6-426c-a9fd-6d00acc07ef8": {"__data__": {"id_": "42b3b96d-5fc6-426c-a9fd-6d00acc07ef8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "def191b0-66af-49e2-b740-0f0d8fd16086", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "1c001bc3ce8e15c47e28afe2026e901642e6fac8e777c78747d34a0b19df547c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "279b8900-aafb-4a5f-a6e8-534a3dffb2cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "42013d63964989f24b9e4ddee804e47871051367f50a7c10b69cac6e1b2cfaa9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c958d5d5-d7ee-42e4-82b8-f08fb35975a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ffb2e1ea00be4d63debe71cc7c3e4995c0198c3bbcb1c1492fc43788cb11ce57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "T\nable of \nContents\nOffsetting of Financial Assets under Master Netting Agreements with Derivative Counterparties\n Gross Amount of Derivative Assets\nPresented in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet\nGross Amounts not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are\nSubject to Master Netting Agreements\n Gross Amount of Eligible\nOffsetting Recognized Derivative\nLiabilities\nCash Collateral Received\nNet Amount of Derivative Assets\n (Millions)\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\nDerivatives subject to master netting\nagreements\n$\n217\n$\n119\n$\n40\n$\n25\n$\n\u2014\n$\n\u2014\n \n$\n177\n$\n94\n \nDerivatives not subject to master netting\nagreements\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n \nTotal\n$\n217\n$\n119\n$\n177\n$\n94\n \nOffsetting of Financial Liabilities under Master Netting Agreements with Derivative Counterparties\n Gross Amount of Derivative\nLiabilities Presented in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nGross Amounts not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are\nSubject to Master Netting Agreements\n Gross Amount of Eligible\nOffsetting Recognized Derivative\nAssets\nCash Collateral Received\nNet Amount of Derivative\nLiabilities\n (Millions)\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\nDerivatives subject to master netting\nagreements\n$\n142\n$\n33\n$\n40\n$\n25\n$\n\u2014\n$\n\u2014\n \n$\n102\n$\n8\n \nDerivatives not subject to master netting\nagreements\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n \nTotal\n$\n142\n$\n33\n$\n102\n$\n8\n \nCurrency Effects\n3M estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, increased pre-tax income by approximately $\n127\n million in 2022, decreased\npre-tax income by approximately $\n105\n million in 2021, and decreased pre-tax income by approximately $\n21\n million in 2020.

Separately, there were no material fair value\nmeasurements with respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company\u2019s financial statements on a recurring basis for 2022\nand 2021.\n3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets and liabilities. Following is a\ndescription of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities \u2014 except certain U.S. municipal securities:\nMarketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for these securities. Market prices are\nobtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These\nmultiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all\nother marketable securities (excluding certain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2. Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 11.\n92", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3511, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c958d5d5-d7ee-42e4-82b8-f08fb35975a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c958d5d5-d7ee-42e4-82b8-f08fb35975a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "494d6f1b-1b1e-42b1-97c5-fdd57645263c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "087b8769183cc1c3bae690d02155fd68f17d3b07ba6b48aaab2155889a97b8a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "42b3b96d-5fc6-426c-a9fd-6d00acc07ef8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "1c001bc3ce8e15c47e28afe2026e901642e6fac8e777c78747d34a0b19df547c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "608afce1-f220-49bb-8dc2-48b649bbaa49", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eebfcad58e818a4cde2c9f6c87a7df81806ff2e6c797ea9a2f5a7c340d28b214", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "T\nable of \nContents\nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities \u2014certain U.S. municipal securities only:\n3M holds municipal securities with several cities in the United States as of December 31, 2022.

Industry standard data providers are\n3M\u2019s primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or\ncounterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.\nThe following tables provide information by level for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nFair Value at\nFair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nDescription (Millions)\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\nAssets:\nAvailable-for-sale:\nMarketable securities:\nCommercial paper\n$\n213\n \n$\n109\n \n$\n\u2014\n \n$\n\u2014\n \n$\n213\n \n$\n109\n \n$\n\u2014\n \n$\n\u2014\n \nCertificates of deposit/time deposits\n21\n \n14\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n21\n \n14\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \nU.S. treasury securities\n\u2014\n \n75\n \n\u2014\n \n75\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \nU.S. municipal securities\n27\n \n30\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n27\n \n30\n \nDerivative instruments \u2014 assets:\nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n217\n \n119\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n217\n \n119\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \nLiabilities:\nDerivative instruments \u2014 liabilities:\nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n40\n \n24\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n40\n \n24\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \nInterest rate contracts\n102\n \n9\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n102\n \n9\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the table above that used significant\nunobservable inputs (level 3).\nMarketable securities \u2014 certain U.S. municipal securities only\n(Millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nBeginning balance\n$\n30\n \n$\n34\n \n$\n46\n \nTotal gains or losses:\nIncluded in earnings\n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \nIncluded in other comprehensive income\n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \nPurchases and issuances\n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n10\n \nSales and settlements\n(\n3\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n22\n)\nTransfers in and/or out of level 3\n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \nEnding balance\n$\n27\n \n$\n30\n \n$\n34\n \nChange in unrealized gains or losses for the period included in earnings for securities held at the end of the\nreporting period\n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n93", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3562, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "608afce1-f220-49bb-8dc2-48b649bbaa49": {"__data__": {"id_": "608afce1-f220-49bb-8dc2-48b649bbaa49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "093c8066-b818-4b8e-baa6-76e75bd537e6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "fa7e04b912b1870b306ce685ddd6cdd5af605af950cb6f14917b64deb546007e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c958d5d5-d7ee-42e4-82b8-f08fb35975a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "087b8769183cc1c3bae690d02155fd68f17d3b07ba6b48aaab2155889a97b8a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e352e5f-1ab9-48c5-bc58-99ac0eac8a34", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d955980c3f1a231e50c6ae600cbfebf73b2542cb290219e609221dbd9afa6fd8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "T\nable of \nContents\nIn addition, the plan assets of 3M\u2019s pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually). Refer to Note 13.\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis:\nDisclosures are required for certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods\nsubsequent to initial recognition. For 3M, such measurements of fair value relate primarily to indefinite-lived and long-lived asset impairments, goodwill impairments, and\nadjustment in carrying value of equity securities for which the measurement alternative of cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes is used. There were \nno\nmaterial impairments of assets or adjustments to equity securities using the measurement alternative for 2022 and 2021. In September 2022, management committed to a plan to\nexit and dispose of net assets in Russia through an intended sale of related subsidiaries. As a result, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n109\n million, primarily within selling,\ngeneral and administrative expense related to recording this held-for-sale disposal group at the lower of its fair value less cost to sell or carrying amount. In determining the\ncarrying amount, the balance of cumulative translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive loss that will be eliminated upon sale was included and contributed\nto the impairment charge. As of December 31, 2022 the amounts of major assets and liabilities of this held-for-sale disposal group primarily included approximately $\n50\n million\nwithin other current liabilities that largely represented a reserve against the balance of cumulative translation adjustment. Additionally, in December 2022, 3M committed to a\nplan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing by the end of 2025. As a result, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n0.8\n billion in the fourth quarter of 2022,\nrelated to impairment of long-lived and indefinite-lived assets ($\n0.5\n billion \u2014 primarily associated with property, plant, and equipment) and impairment of goodwill ($\n0.3\nbillion). These charges were reflected within selling, general and administrative expense and goodwill impairment expense, respectively. The plan affects each of the Electronics\nMaterials Solutions Division and Advanced Materials Division asset groupings/reporting units (both part of the Transportation and Electronics business) with impairment\nresulting for the Advanced Materials Division. Underlying fair values were determined primarily using discounted cash flow models based on assumptions of projected sales,\nEBITDA margins, capital expenditures, discount rates and other applicable items. Significant unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair values of the asset groupings\nincluded discount rates, which were \n11\n% to \n12\n%.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments:\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, certain investments, accounts payable, borrowings, and\nderivative contracts. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt approximated\ncarrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Available-for-sale marketable securities, in addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair\nvalues as indicated in the preceding disclosures. To estimate fair values (classified as level 2) for its long-term debt, the Company utilized third-party quotes, which are derived\nall or in part from model prices, external sources, market prices, or the third-party\u2019s internal records. \nInformation with respect to the carrying amounts and estimated fair values\nof these financial instruments follow:\n2022\n2021\n(Millions)\nCarrying Value\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nFair Value\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion\n$\n14,001\n \n$\n12,484\n \n$\n16,056\n \n$\n17,601\n \nThe fair values reflected in the sections above consider the terms of the related debt absent the impacts of derivative/hedging activity.

These claims,\nlawsuits and proceedings include, but are not limited to, products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property,\ncommercial, antitrust, federal healthcare program related laws and regulations, such as the False Claims Act and anti-kickback laws, securities, and environmental laws in the\nUnited States and other jurisdictions. Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation and proceedings. From time to time, the Company also\nreceives subpoenas, investigative demands or requests for information from various government agencies in the United States and foreign countries. The Company generally\nresponds in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner. These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company.\nSuch requests can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of administrative, civil, or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and others, as well as to\nsettlements. The outcomes of legal proceedings and regulatory matters are often difficult to predict. Any determination that the Company\u2019s operations or activities are not, or\nwere not, in compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, civil or criminal penalties, and equitable remedies, including disgorgement,\nsuspension or debarment or injunctive relief.\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings\nMany lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and alleged actual damages, all of which are otherwise subject to substantial\nuncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. When\nmaking determinations about recording liabilities related to legal proceedings, the Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, \nContingencies\n, and related guidance,\nand records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable\nloss is a range, the Company records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The\nCompany either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The\nCompany discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at\nleast a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.\nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the Company may not ultimately incur\ncharges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. Many of the matters described are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate amount of damages. It is not uncommon for\nclaims to be resolved over many years. A future adverse ruling, settlement, unfavorable development, or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters could result in\nfuture charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded. Based on experience and\ndevelopments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability\npreviously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable. Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities.

A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the\nCompany generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well\nas products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\nThe Company\u2019s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects that filing of claims\nby unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including\nmesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past \ntwenty\n plus years, the Company has\nprevailed in \nfifteen\n of the \nsixteen\n cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described below). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict in its favor in \ntwo\n lawsuits \u2013 \none\n in\nCalifornia state court in February and the other in Massachusetts state court in December \u2013 both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the\nplaintiffs against asbestos fibers. In April 2018, a jury in state court in Kentucky found 3M\u2019s 8710 respirators failed to protect \ntwo\n coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded\ncompensatory damages of approximately $\n2\n million and punitive damages totaling $\n63\n million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company appealed. In\n2019, the Company settled a substantial majority of the then-pending coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and West Virginia for $\n340\n million, including the jury verdict in\nApril 2018 in the Kentucky case mentioned above and the appeal has been dismissed. In October 2020, 3M defended a respirator case before a jury in King County,\nWashington, involving a former shipyard worker who alleged 3M\u2019s 8710 respirator was defective and that 3M acted negligently in failing to protect him against asbestos fibers.\nThe jury delivered a complete defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that the 8710 respirator was not defective in design or warnings and any conduct by 3M was not a\ncause of plaintiff\u2019s mesothelioma. The plaintiff appealed the verdict. In May 2022, the First Division intermediate appellate court in Washington affirmed in part and reversed in\npart 3M\u2019s trial victory, concluding that the trial court misapplied Washington law in instructing the jury about factual causation. The Washington Supreme Court declined to\nreview the matter.\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the\nintended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the\nCompany\u2019s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company\u2019s litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including\nmesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving\npending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically\nunimpaired claimants. Since the second half of 2020, the Company has experienced an increase in the number of cases filed that allege injuries from exposures to coal mine\ndust; that increase represents the substantial majority of the growth in case numbers referred to above.\nAs previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and \ntwo\n other manufacturers of respiratory\nprotection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005.

A\nbench trial for the unfair trade practices claims has been rescheduled for late February 2023.

The Company reviews recent and historical claims data, including\nwithout limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the Company, (ii) the nature and mix of those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the\nCompany\u2019s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing\nproducts allegedly manufactured by the Company), (iii) the costs to defend and resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims,\n(collectively, the \u201cClaims Data\u201d). As part of its comprehensive legal review, the Company regularly provides the Claims Data to a third party with expertise in determining the\nimpact of Claims Data on future filing trends and costs. The third party assists the Company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. The\nCompany uses these estimates to develop its best estimate of probable liability.\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the Company\u2019s estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes in (i) the key\nassumptions underlying the Company\u2019s accrual, including, the number of future claims, the nature and mix of those claims, the average cost of defending and resolving claims,\nand in maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii) the law and procedure applicable to these claims, and (iv) the financial viability of other co-defendants\nand insurers.\nAs a result of its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, of pending and expected lawsuits and of the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious\ninjuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, the Company increased its accruals in 2022 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $\n31\n million.\nIn 2022, the Company made payments for legal defense costs and settlements of $\n67\n million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of December 31, 2022, the\nCompany had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo accruals) of $\n604\n million. This accrual represents the Company\u2019s best estimate of probable\nloss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Company approaching the year 2050. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper\nend of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims\nthat have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where the\ndamages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant\u2019s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by\nstate, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may\noccur that could affect the Company\u2019s estimate of liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $\n4\n million. In addition, the Company\ncontinues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers.

Responsibility for legal costs, as well as\nfor settlements and judgments, is shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their\nrespective insurers (the \u201cPayor Group\u201d). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the \u201cAO Safety\u201d\nbrand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo\u2019s share of the contingent\nliability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly\nfee of $\n100,000\n, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica\nproducts for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being\nsold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to\nJanuary 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearo\u2019s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to\nasbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for\nsome part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able\nto meet its obligations in these matters.\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo\u2019s liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in the number of\nfuture claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in\nthe mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes\nin the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor Group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits,\nand/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot\ndetermine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearo\u2019s share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments\ndescribed above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued. Because of the\ninherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the Payor Group,\nand the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo\u2019s liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by\nwhich Aearo\u2019s liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.\nEnvironmental Matters and Litigation\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic or hazardous substances,\nand the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, many for which private parties in the United\nStates and abroad have rights of action.

The Company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately \ntwo years\n of the phase-out announcement and ceased all\nmanufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. The Company continues to manufacture a variety of shorter chain length PFAS compounds,\nincluding, but not limited to, pre-cursor compounds to perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS). These compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including\nengineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. Through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw\nmaterial composition identification processes associated with the Company\u2019s policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues\nto review, control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts in some of 3M\u2019s current manufacturing\nprocesses, products, and waste streams.\n3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025; and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product\nportfolio by the end of 2025. 3M\u2019s decision is based on careful consideration and a thorough evaluation of the evolving external landscape, including multiple factors such as\naccelerating regulatory trends focused on reducing or eliminating the presence of PFAS in the environment and changing stakeholder expectations.\nPFAS Regulatory and Legislative Activity\nRegulatory and legislative activities concerning PFAS are accelerating in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. These activities\ninclude gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment activities, consideration of regulatory approaches, and increasingly strict restrictions on various uses of\nPFAS in products and on PFAS in manufacturing emissions, in some cases moving towards non-detectable limits for certain PFAS compounds. Regulations of PFAS in\nemissions and in environmental media such as soil and water (including drinking water) are increasingly being set at levels that continue to decrease. Global regulations also\nappear to be increasingly focused on a broader group of PFAS, and may include those PFAS compounds used in current products. If such activity continues and regulations\nbecome final and enforceable, 3M may incur material costs to comply with new regulatory requirements or as a result of litigation or additional enforcement actions.

The implementation of process improvements and analytical work is ongoing.\n3M Belgium, a subsidiary of the Company, has been working with the Public Flemish Waste Agency (OVAM) for several years to investigate and remediate historical PFAS\ncontaminations at and near the 3M Belgium facility in Zwijndrecht, Antwerp, Belgium. In connection with a ring road construction project (the Oosterweel Project) in Antwerp\nthat involved extensive soil work, an investigative committee with judicial investigatory powers was formed in June 2021 by the Flemish Parliament to investigate PFAS found\nin the soil and groundwater near the Zwijndrecht facility. 3M Belgium testified at Flemish parliamentary committee hearings in June and September 2021 on PFAS-related\nmatters. The Flemish Parliament, the Minister of the Environment, and regulatory authorities initiated investigations and demands for information related to the release of PFAS\nfrom the Zwijndrecht facility. The Company has cooperated with the authorities in the investigations and information requests and is working with the authorities on an ongoing\nbasis, as they continue to maintain oversight of 3M Belgium\u2019s operations at the Zwijndrecht facility, as further discussed below. Separately, as previously disclosed, the\nCompany is aware that certain residents of Zwijndrecht and non-governmental organizations filed a criminal complaint with an Antwerp investigatory judge against 3M\nBelgium, alleging it had unlawfully abandoned waste in violation of its environmental care obligations.\n Certain additional parties reportedly joined the complaint\n. 3M Belgium\nhas not been served with any such complaint.\nSafety measures \u2013 wastewater discharge. In August 2021, the Flemish Government served 3M Belgium with a safety measure requiring the capture of certain process\nwastewaters to prevent their entry into the site wastewater treatment plant. While 3M Belgium appealed the Safety Measure due to the belief it lacked adequate legal and factual\nfoundation, 3M Belgium promptly implemented the required actions.\nIn October 2021, the Province of Antwerp unilaterally adopted lower discharge limits for the nine PFAS compounds specifically identified in the water discharge permit and\nadded a special condition that essentially prohibits discharge of any PFAS chemistry without a specific limit in the permit. 3M Belgium received a new two-year permit in May\n2022 which contains strict new limits for 24 different PFAS, effective July 1, 2022. 3M Belgium believes that the recently installed additional control systems will enable it to\nmeet these limits. Subsequently, the environmental enforcement agency has recently informed 3M Belgium that the agency believes that 3M Belgium must apply for discharge\nlimits for certain additional \u201cshort-chain\u201d PFAS pursuant to the special condition. Although disagreeing with the agency\u2019s position, 3M Belgium is in the process of developing\nthe application to amend the permit to add the additional PFAS. 3M Belgium has insufficient information to predict the limits that will be set forth for additional short-chain\nPFAS and is therefore unable to assess whether the current or future wastewater treatment system, as currently conceived, will meet future limits imposed. In December 2022,\n3M Belgium received an official infraction report from the Flemish Environmental Inspectorate regarding the discharge of certain short chain PFAS compounds in wastewater\nfrom the Zwijndrecht facility. 3M Belgium previously identified these compounds and shared the results with the Inspectorate. The compounds at issue do not have specific\ndischarge limits in the applicable wastewater discharge permit, and the infraction report references a special condition in the permit that prohibits detectable discharge of PFAS\ncompounds that do not have a specific discharge limit in the permit. 3M Belgium disagrees with the Inspectorate\u2019s interpretation of the special condition and the time period\npermitted for compliance with it.

In December 2022, 3M Belgium provided the inspectorate with responses to the allegations,\nincluding plans and timelines for compliance where applicable, and plans to continue to inform the inspectorate on corrective actions to be taken.\nAs of July 2022, the authorities have approved the restart of key production processes and 3M Belgium continues to conduct required monitoring and reporting activities.\nBelgian government authorities continue to maintain oversight of 3M Belgium\u2019s operations and compliance with applicable requirements at the Zwijndrecht facility. In\nSeptember 2022, the environmental enforcement agency issued an infraction report alleging that 3M Belgium had misconstrued an exemption in the safety measure and thus\nnot fully complied with the safety measure in the operation of certain production lines. Discussions are underway with the environmental enforcement agency and those\nproduction lines are now being addressed in accordance with the review and approval provisions of the safety measure. Although the authorities have approved the restart and/or\ncontinued operation of key production processes, a negative development in their ongoing oversight review, or inability to fully restart all production processes, could have a\nsignificant adverse impact on 3M Belgium\u2019s normal operations and the Company's businesses that receive products and other materials from the facility, some of which may\nnot be available in similar quantities from other 3M facilities, which could in turn impact these businesses\u2019 ability to fulfill supply obligations to their customers.

Also in September 2021, the Flemish Region issued a notice of default alleging violations of environmental laws and seeking\nPFAS-related information, indemnity and a remediation plan for soil and water impacts due to PFAS originating from the Zwijndrecht facility. In September 2021, 3M\nresponded to the notice of default and announced a plan to invest up to \n125\n million euros in the next \nthree years\n in actions related to the Zwijndrecht community, including\nsupport for local commercial farmers impacted by restrictions on sale of agricultural products, and enhancements to site discharge control technologies. 3M is also committed to\npayment for ongoing off-site descriptive soil investigation and appropriate soil remediation. In March 2022, the Company announced an investment of \n150\n million euros to\nadvance remedial actions to address legacy PFAS previously produced at the Zwijndrecht facility. An accredited third-party soil remediation expert has progressed towards a\nremedial action plan based on a descriptive soil investigation that would help inform 3M Belgium\u2019s remedial actions onsite and in certain surrounding areas. 3M Belgium\nrepresentatives continue to have discussions with the relevant authorities regarding further soil remedial actions in connection with the Flemish Soil Decree, which requires both\npublic authorities and private parties to remediate contaminated soil and groundwater in Flanders. 3M Belgium cannot exclude the possibility of future government executive\ndecisions expanding its remedial obligations under the Soil Decree, including through a proposed executive decision that may be finalized in 2023 following an anticipated\nadvisory opinion from the Belgian administrative court. 3M Belgium submitted a letter to that court identifying several procedural and legal issues with the proposed executive\ndecision.

In October 2021, EPA released\nits \u201cPFAS Strategic Roadmap: EPA's Commitments to Action 2021-2024,\u201d which presents EPA\u2019s approach to PFAS, including investing in research to increase the\nunderstanding of PFAS, pursuing a comprehensive approach to proactively control PFAS exposures to humans and the environment, and broadening and accelerating the scope\nof clean-up of PFAS in the environment.\nIn June 2022, EPA released new final lifetime health advisory levels for PFBS (2,000 ppt) and HFPO-DA and its salts (\u201cGenX\u201d) (4 ppt), and new interim lifetime health\nadvisory levels for PFOA (.004 ppt) and PFOS (.02 ppt). Lifetime health advisories are intended to provide information about concentrations of drinking water contaminants at\nwhich adverse health effects are not expected to occur over the specified exposure duration. The health advisories are non-enforceable and non-regulatory, but if EPA uses the\nsame methodology in setting national primary drinking water standards, discussed further below, or other national or state regulations, 3M could incur additional costs and\npotential exposures, including in future compliance costs, possible litigation and/or enforcement actions.\nIn May 2021, the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) within the Department of Health and Human Services finalized a Toxicological Profile for\ncertain PFAS that established minimal risk levels (MRLs) for PFOS, PFOA and several other PFAS. An MRL is an estimate of the daily human exposure to a hazardous\nsubstance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of adverse non-cancer health effects over a specified duration of exposure. MRLs establish a screening level and are not\nintended to define cleanup or action levels for ATSDR or other agencies. Earlier, in April 2021, EPA released a final toxicity assessment for PFBS.\nIn May 2022, EPA added five PFAS substances \u2013 HFPO-DA, PFOS, PFOA perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) -- to its list of Regional\nScreening and Removal Management Levels based on the May 2021 MRLs. EPA had previously added PFBS to both lists in 2014. Regional Screening Levels are used to\nidentify contaminated media that may require further investigation, while Regional Removal Management Levels are used by EPA to support certain actions under CERCLA.\nEPA began the process of establishing a national primary drinking water regulation for PFOA and PFOS in November 2021 by referring its proposed approach to developing a\nMaximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) to the Science Advisory Board (SAB) and soliciting public comment. The Company submitted initial comments in December\n2021 and supplemental comments in January and February 2022. In August 2022, the Science Advisory Board published its final report analyzing EPA\u2019s proposed approach to\ndeveloping a MCLG. EPA submitted the draft MCL and MCLG for PFOA and PFOS to OMB for review in October 2022. \nEPA is expected to publish a proposed MCLG and\nnational primary drinking water standard in early 2023. In November 2022, EPA published its final Drinking Water Contaminant Candidates List 5 (CCL 5), which includes a\nbroad group of PFAS that are not currently subject to national primary drinking water regulations but which EPA is considering for regulation under the Safe Drinking Water\nAct (SDWA). In December 2022, EPA issued guidance to states for incorporating PFAS requirements into the Clean Water Act National Pollution Discharge Elimination\nSystem (NPDES) permit program, including recommendations to require PFAS monitoring and incorporating limits for PFAS in industrial discharges.\nIn October 2021, EPA announced it will initiate a rulemaking to designate four PFAS compounds as hazardous constituents under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\n(RCRA). Further, in September 2022, EPA published in the Federal Register its proposal to list PFOA and PFOS, including their salts and structural isomers, as CERCLA\nhazardous substances. 3M submitted comments on EPA\u2019s proposal in November 2022.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4232, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc6e6e5a-14de-48c9-b13c-09b27edd27c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc6e6e5a-14de-48c9-b13c-09b27edd27c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f93a3ae-f909-4cf8-80c7-6303b505d733", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "462bf5439fed07436f9c15331bbd6feaafe62941f292df9a8ddc734a62f11066", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fcd762b5-ef6e-4826-a929-3546006d35c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "217fffdaab517d1b54822b0b025f5e7b5611f5e1626180040960313f491de7ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c0d6559f-5c7d-485a-bc75-0beb34010f46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b2ff50b5dfe574b277213f0744435d402440ac95ccfad6afcaeb489c536ffe74", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In December 2022, EPA issued guidance to states for incorporating PFAS requirements into the Clean Water Act National Pollution Discharge Elimination\nSystem (NPDES) permit program, including recommendations to require PFAS monitoring and incorporating limits for PFAS in industrial discharges.\nIn October 2021, EPA announced it will initiate a rulemaking to designate four PFAS compounds as hazardous constituents under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\n(RCRA).

These criteria, once finalized, may be used by states in developing water quality standards for\nprotection of aquatic life under the Clean Water Act. 3M submitted comments on the draft criteria in July 2022.\nUnited States: State Activity\nSeveral state legislatures and state agencies have been evaluating or have taken actions related to cleanup standards, groundwater values or drinking water values for PFOS,\nPFOA, and other PFAS, and 3M has submitted various responsive comments. In Minnesota, the Minnesota Department of Health in May 2017 stated that Health Based Values\n(HBVs) \u201care designed to reduce long-term health risks across the population and are based on multiple safety factors to protect the most vulnerable citizens, which makes them\noverprotective for most of the residents in our state.\u201d As of 2021, the current HBVs are 35 ppt for PFOA, 15 ppt for PFOS, 47 ppt for PFHxS and 2 ppb for PFBS.\nThe Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) published the final version of its PFAS Monitoring Plan in March 2022. Four 3M facilities - Cottage Grove, Maplewood,\nHutchinson, and Woodbury - are among the 137 Minnesota facilities that are preliminarily scoped to be within the Monitoring Plan.\nStates with finalized drinking water standards for certain PFAS include California, Vermont, New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire, Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania\nand Wisconsin.\nSome other states have also been evaluating or have taken actions relating to PFOA, PFOS and other PFAS compounds in products such as food packaging, carpets and other\nproducts. For example, in June 2022, Colorado enacted a law which restricts the sale of certain consumer products, including carpets and furniture, fabric treatments, food\npackaging, and children\u2019s products that contain intentionally added PFAS.\nIn October 2022, California passed\n \nlegislation prohibiting the manufacture, distribution of sale of textiles and cosmetics containing certain PFAS. Additionally, in 2021 and\n2022, California finalized its listing of PFOS (and its salts and transformation and degradation precursors) and PFOA as carcinogens, and PFNA as a reproductive toxicant\nunder its Proposition 65 law. California has also proposed listing PFDA, PFHxS, and PFUNDA as reproductive toxicants under Proposition 65.\nIn the Summer of 2021, the State of Maine passed its Act To Stop Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Pollution, which bans intentionally added PFAS in products\neffective January 1, 2030 and requires broad reporting of products containing intentionally-added PFAS effective January 1, 2023. In December 2022, 3M submitted to the\nMaine Department of Environmental Protection a list of products containing intentionally added PFAS that have been sold in the U.S. in the past two years in compliance with\nthe law.\nIn October 2020, 3M and several other parties filed notices of appeal in the appellate division of the Superior Court of New Jersey to challenge the validity of the New Jersey\nPFOS and PFOA regulations. In January 2021, the appellate division of the court denied the group\u2019s motion to stay the regulations. The court heard oral argument in November\n2022.\nIn March 2021, 3M filed a lawsuit against the New York State Department of Health, on the grounds that drinking water levels set by the agency for PFOS and PFOA should be\nvacated because they are arbitrary and did not comply with statutorily required processes. An oral argument on the merits was held in December 2021. In June 2022, the court\nissued a decision denying and dismissing the Company\u2019s lawsuit on standing grounds. The Company has filed a notice of appeal in July 2022 and decided in January 2023 not\nto pursue the appeal\nIn April 2021, 3M also filed a lawsuit against the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) to invalidate the drinking water standards EGLE\npromulgated under an accelerated timeline.

Given\ndivergent and rapidly evolving regulatory standards, there is currently significant uncertainty about the potential costs to industry and communities associated with remediation\nand control technologies that may be required.\nLitigation Related to Historical PFAS Manufacturing Operations in Alabama\nAs previously reported, 3M has resolved numerous claims relating to alleged PFAS contamination of properties and water supplies by 3M\u2019s Decatur, Alabama manufacturing\nfacility. In April 2019, 3M settled a lawsuit brought by the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water & Sewer Authority for $\n35\n million, which will fund a new water filtration\nsystem, with 3M indemnifying the Water Authority from liability resulting from the resolution of certain lawsuits against the Water Authority alleging liability or damages\nrelated to 3M PFAS. In October 2021, 3M settled a class action brought by plaintiffs who were supplied drinking water by the Water Authority (the \u201cLindsey\u201d case) for an\nimmaterial amount. The court issued a final order approving the class settlement and dismissing the action in March 2022.\n \nIn October 2021, 3M also reached agreements in\nprinciple to resolve litigation with the Tennessee Riverkeeper organization, the St. John plaintiff class, plaintiffs in the Stover, Owens, and Chandler matters. A court granted\nfinal approval of the St. John class settlement in April 2022, and plaintiffs in the Stover, Owens, and Chandler matters filed dismissals thereafter. In June 2022, the court\ndismissed the Tennessee Riverkeeper case with prejudice. In November 2021, 3M and the City of Decatur, Decatur Utilities and Morgan County executed a collaborative\nagreement under which the Company agreed to contribute approximately $\n99\n million and also to continue to address certain PFAS-related matters in the area. The contribution\nrelates to initiatives to improve the quality of life and overall environment in Decatur, including community redevelopment and recreation projects by the City, County and\nDecatur Utilities. It also includes addressing certain PFAS matters at the Morgan County landfill and reimbursement of costs previously incurred related to PFAS remediation.\n3M will continue to address PFAS at certain other closed municipal sites at which the Company historically disposed waste and continue environmental characterization in the\narea. This work will complement the Interim Consent Order that 3M entered with ADEM in 2020 and includes sampling of environmental media, such as ground water,\nregarding the potential presence of PFAS at the 3M Decatur facility and legacy disposal sites, as well as supporting the execution of appropriate remedial actions. In March\n2022, 3M reached a settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the Billings matter, resulting in dismissal of the case in August 2022.\n \nIn August 2022, 3M reached an agreement to\nsettle personal injury claims brought by \n37\n individual plaintiffs in the King matter. 3M continues to negotiate with individual property owners regarding claims relating to\nformer 3M disposal sites and has resolved several such claims for an immaterial amount.\nIn September 2020, the City of Guin Water Works and Sewer Board (Guin WWSB) brought a lawsuit against 3M in Alabama state court alleging that PFAS contamination in\nthe Guin water system stems from manufacturing operations at 3M\u2019s Guin facility and disposal activity at a nearby landfill. Guin WWSB dismissed its lawsuit without\nprejudice in order to work with 3M to further investigate the presence of chemicals in the area; and in December 2021, the parties reached a settlement under which 3M agreed\nto contribute $\n30\n million that will be used on a new treatment system for Guin\u2019s drinking water and a new wastewater treatment facility. In March 2022, a new putative class\naction was filed in the Northern District of Alabama on behalf of Guin WWSB ratepayers. Defendants include 3M, the Guin landfill, the Guin WWSB, and some waste\ntransporters.

In March 2019, the New Jersey Attorney General filed \ntwo\n actions against 3M, DuPont, and Chemours on behalf of the New Jersey Department of Environmental\nProtection (NJDEP), the NJDEP\u2019s commissioner, and the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund regarding alleged discharges at \ntwo\n DuPont facilities in Pennsville, New Jersey\n(Salem County) and Parlin, New Jersey (Middlesex County). 3M is included as a defendant in both cases because it allegedly supplied PFOA to DuPont for use at the facilities\nat issue. Both cases expressly seek to have the defendants pay all costs necessary to investigate, remediate, assess, and restore the affected natural resources of New Jersey.\nDuPont removed these cases to federal court. In June 2020, the court consolidated the \ntwo\n actions, along with \ntwo\n others brought by the NJDEP relating to the DuPont facilities,\nfor case management and pretrial purposes. The parties are conducting discovery.\nNew Hampshire. In May 2019, the New Hampshire Attorney General filed \ntwo\n lawsuits alleging contamination of the state\u2019s drinking water supplies and other natural resources\nby PFAS chemicals. As described above, one lawsuit was transferred to the AFFF MDL. The Company recently removed the other case to federal court and attempted to\ntransfer it to the AFFF MDL, which was denied at this juncture in the litigation. The state has moved to remand the case back to state court, which remains pending.\nVermont. In June 2019, the Vermont Attorney General filed \ntwo\n lawsuits alleging contamination of the state\u2019s drinking water supplies and other natural resources by PFAS\nchemicals. As described above, one lawsuit was transferred to the AFFF MDL. The other suit asserts PFAS contamination from non-AFFF sources and names 3M and several\nentities related to DuPont and Chemours as defendants. This suit is proceeding in state court, where the parties are engaging in discovery and the court has set a trial-ready date\nin October 2024.\nIn October 2022, the Vermont Attorney General amended the complaint in the non-AFFF lawsuit, to add claims related to PFBS and GenX and to add a claim under Vermont\u2019s\nWaste Management Act, which was recently amended to add manufacturers as liable parties for the release or threatened release of hazardous materials (which in Vermont\nincludes certain PFAS compounds).\nIllinois. In March 2022, the Illinois Attorney General filed a lawsuit in Illinois state court against 3M alleging contamination of the state's natural resources by PFAS compounds\ndisposed of by, or discharged, or emitted from 3M's Cordova plant. The complaint requests monetary damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, a testing program, and a public\noutreach and information sharing program. The case was removed to federal court and 3M moved to transfer it to the AFFF MDL, which was denied at this stage in the\nlitigation. The state has moved to remand the case back to state court. In January 2023, the Illinois Attorney General filed a new lawsuit against 3M and other defendants in\nIllinois state court, alleging contamination of a number of drinking water systems and natural resource damages at several sites statewide, and seeking to recover monetary\ndamages, injunctive relief for remediation, civil penalties and other relief.

Over the past four years, the parties in the MDL have conducted substantial discovery, including ongoing\nmaster discovery and several rounds of discovery involving potential water supplier bellwether cases.\n \nIn September 2022, the court selected the City of Stuart, Florida public\nwater supplier case as the first bellwether trial, to begin in June 2023. The court has also directed the parties to submit a proposal for an initial set of personal injury bellwether\ncases.\n \nIn September 2022, the court issued an order denying defendants\u2019 MDL-wide summary judgment motions on the government contractor defense, which defense can be\npresented to a jury at future trials. The MDL court has repeatedly encouraged the parties to negotiate to resolve cases in the MDL. In October 2022, the court appointed a retired\nfederal judge as mediator, who has held several initial mediation sessions with plaintiff and defense leadership in November and December 2022.\nIn June 2019, several subsidiaries of Valero Energy Corporation, an independent petroleum refiner, filed \neight\n AFFF cases against 3M and other defendants, including\nDuPont/Chemours, National Foam, Buckeye Fire Equipment, and Kidde-Fenwal, in various state courts. Plaintiffs seek damages that allegedly have been or will be incurred in\ninvestigating and remediating PFAS contamination at their properties and replacing or disposing of AFFF products containing long-chain PFAS compounds. \nTwo\n of these cases\nhave been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. \nFive\n cases remain pending in state courts where they are stayed by agreement of the parties.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company is aware of approximately \n50\n other AFFF suits originally filed in various state courts in which the Company has been named a\ndefendant. 3M anticipates that most of these cases will eventually be removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL; however, at least two personal injury cases are\nexpected to remain pending in state courts.\nSeparately, the Company is aware of pre-suit claims or demands by other parties related to the use and disposal of AFFF, one of which purports to represent a large group of\nfirefighters. The Company had discussions with certain potential pre-suit claimants and, as a result of such discussions, reached a negotiated resolution for an immaterial\namount with the City of Bemidji in March 2021.\nOther PFAS-related Product and Environmental Litigation\n3M manufactured and sold various products containing PFOA and PFOS, including Scotchgard, for several decades.

The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the\nproduct. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties,\ndiminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs.

The plaintiffs in these cases allege that the carpet manufacturers improperly discharged PFAS into the surface water and\ngroundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa River, including Rome, Georgia and Centre, Alabama. These water utility\ncases have been proceeding through discovery. The City of Rome case has been scheduled for trial in June 2023. In September 2022, the Company reached an agreement with\nthe Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board to resolve a similar matter. This development, as with developments on other PFAS matters, was reflected in determining changes\nto 3M\u2019s accrual for PFAS-related \"other environmental liabilities.\" Another case originally filed in Georgia state court was brought by individuals asserting PFAS\ncontamination by the Georgia carpet manufacturers and seeking economic damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of Rome and Floyd County water\nsubscribers. This case has been removed to federal court, where the case is proceeding through discovery.\n3M, together with co-defendants, is also defending another putative class action in federal court in Georgia, in which plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of a class of individual\nratepayers in Summerville, Georgia who allege their water supply was contaminated by PFAS discharged from a textile mill. In May 2021, the City of Summerville filed a\nmotion to intervene in the lawsuit, which was granted in March 2022. This case is now proceeding through discovery.\nIn July 2022, a putative class action was filed against 3M and other PFAS manufacturers by The Utilities Board of Tuskegee on behalf of all drinking water utilities within\nAlabama whose finished drinking water has contained a detectable concentration level of PFOA, PFOS, GenX, or PFBS that exceed the June 2022 health advisory levels issued\nby the U.S. EPA. 3M filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in October 2022.\nIn California, 3M, Decra Roofing and certain DuPont-related entities were named as defendants in an action brought in state court by the City of Corona and a local utility\nauthority, alleging PFAS contamination of the plaintiffs\u2019 water sources and also referring to 3M's industrial minerals facility in Corona, California as a potential source of\ncontamination. The court granted demurrers filed by Decra and the DuPont entities, while 3M answered the complaint in February 2022. The case is proceeding through\ndiscovery as to plaintiff and 3M. In June 2022, the Sacramento Suburban Water District filed a lawsuit in California federal court against 3M and certain other defendants,\nalleging PFAS contamination from 3M products generally. That case has now been transferred to the AFFF MDL. In October 2022, a putative class action was filed against the\nCompany and other parties on behalf of individuals who have been drinking water from the Temescal Subbasin, from which the City of Corona gets its water, seeking\ninjunctive relief, damages, and medical monitoring.\nIn North Carolina, the town of Pittsboro filed a lawsuit in January 2023 against 3M and other defendants in state court related to alleged PFAS contamination of its property and\nwater supply.

The Court denied 3M\u2019s\nmotion for summary judgment in October 2022 and has set a pre-trial conference for March 2023. A trial date has been set for October 2023. In September 2020, 3M was\nnamed a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought by the Borough of Hopatcong. In January 2021, 3M was named a defendant in another similar lawsuit brought by the\nPequannock Township. Fact discovery has closed in both the Hopatcong and Pequannock matters, and expert discovery is set to commence in February 2023 (Hopatcong) and\nMarch 2023 (Pequannock). 3M, together with several co-defendants, is also defending \n27\n cases in New Jersey federal court brought by individuals with private drinking water\nwells near certain DuPont and Solvay facilities that were allegedly supplied with PFAS by 3M. These cases have all been coordinated for discovery, which is ongoing. Plaintiffs\nin \nten\n of these cases seek medical monitoring and property damages. Plaintiffs in the \n16\n remaining individual cases in federal court allege personal injuries to themselves or their\ndisabled adult children. In July 2022, Plaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaints in the first five cases to add claims concerning seven non-PFAS chemistries as against\ndefendants other than 3M. Nine of the remaining personal injury cases were filed in state court and removed to federal court. Plaintiffs are currently seeking remand in four of\nthese cases. In three of these cases, Plaintiffs also assert claims against Clemente Property and the Covanta Waste Disposal Facility. In December 2022, an additional personal\ninjury case was filed in New Jersey State court. 3M and Middlesex Water Company are also defending a putative class action filed in New Jersey federal court in November\n2021 by individuals who received drinking water from Middlesex Water Company that was allegedly contaminated with PFAS. The court denied 3M\u2019s motion to dismiss, and\nthe case is proceeding through discovery. In May 2022, Middlesex Water Company filed a third-party complaint against the Company in New Jersey state court in a putative\nclass action of the state residents who are customers of the water company, seeking indemnity from the Company. After Middlesex Water Company removed the case to federal\ncourt in July 2022, plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to state court. The federal court stayed 3M\u2019s deadline to respond to the third-party complaint until after the motion\nto remand is decided. Finally, in June 2022, a personal injury lawsuit was filed against 3M by a Middlesex Water Company customer. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his\ncomplaint without prejudice and later re-filed in the MDL.\nIn South Carolina, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in South Carolina state court against 3M, DuPont and DuPont related entities in March 2022. The lawsuit alleges\nproperty damage and personal injuries from contamination from PFAS compounds used and disposed of at the textile plant known as the Galey & Lord plant from 1966 until\n2016. The complaint seeks remedies including damages, punitive damages, and medical monitoring. The case has been removed to federal court. Plaintiff recently filed a second\namended complaint.\nIn Massachusetts, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in August 2022 in state court against 3M and several other defendants alleging PFAS contamination from waste\ngenerated by local paper manufacturing facilities. The lawsuit alleges property damage and also seeks medical monitoring on behalf of plaintiffs within the Town of\nWestminster. This case was removed to federal court. 3M anticipates responding to the complaint in the first quarter of 2023.\nIn Maine, a group of landowners filed a second amended complaint in October 2022 in federal district court, adding 3M and several other alleged chemical suppliers as\ndefendants in a case previously filed against several paper mills, alleging PFAS contamination from waste generated by the paper mills.

As offsite\ninvestigation activities continue, additional remediation amounts may become probable and reasonably estimable.\n109", "start_char_idx": 3747, "end_char_idx": 6276, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "163a21b4-1cd7-445c-99a0-1c93b4250c32": {"__data__": {"id_": "163a21b4-1cd7-445c-99a0-1c93b4250c32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b477fe0-a8a3-416b-9fae-3484dafe5528", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "62748908ac83ae6738b99a34892518c877ae297f8f87246b3a3c52ad4924bf71", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f36e027d-6093-4ec1-8187-924ea86016e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "4e35bb21700a47207cbf71244ceb98f86a1a61e8f69f3c65cf4187b00740ddc0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0908ee35-339e-44fc-9f20-66438ea645eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "38e333ca90f5bb1baaa3fbfef64c26a95d6995fa8222ee2a5bcdad22c1c293fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "T\nable of \nContents\nAs previously reported, in December 2019, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Alabama for documents\nrelated to, among other matters, the Company\u2019s compliance with the 2009 TSCA consent order and unpermitted discharges to the Tennessee River. The Company is cooperating\nand providing responsive documents with respect to this and other inquiries regarding its manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition, as previously reported, as part of its ongoing evaluation of regulatory compliance at its Cordova, Illinois facility, the Company discovered it had not fully\ncharacterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit for the Cordova facility. In November 2019, the Company disclosed this matter to the EPA, and in January 2020\ndisclosed this matter to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA), submitted an NPDES permit application for the PFAS in its discharge, and in October 2019, put\non-line and in operation wastewater treatment specifically designed to treat PFAS. The Company continues to work with the EPA and IEPA to address these issues from the\nCordova facility. In November 2022, the Company entered into an SDWA Administrative Consent Order that requires the Company to continue to sample and survey private\nand public drinking water wells within the vicinity of the Cordova facility, provide treatment of private water wells within a three-mile radius of the Cordova facility, and to\nprovide alternate treatment/supply for the Camanche, Iowa public drinking water system.\nIn April 2022, the Company received a TSCA information request from EPA seeking information related to the operation of specific PFAS-related processes, and the Company\nis cooperating with this inquiry and is producing documents and information. In May 2022, the Company received a notice of potential violation and opportunity to confer and a\nnotice of intent to file a complaint from EPA alleging violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) related to the use of emergency spill containment\nunits associated with certain chemical processes at the Cordova facility.\nThe Company is also reviewing operations at its other plants with similar manufacturing processes, such as the plant in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, to ensure those operations are\nin compliance with applicable environmental regulatory requirements and Company policies and procedures. As a result of these reviews, as previously reported, the Company\ndiscovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit for the Cottage Grove facility. In March 2020, the Company disclosed this matter to the\nMinnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and the EPA. In July 2020, the Company received an information request from MPCA for documents and information related to,\namong other matters, the Company\u2019s compliance with the Clean Water Act at its Cottage Grove facility.\u2009The Company is cooperating with this inquiry and is producing\ndocuments and information in response to the request for information.\nSeparately, as previously reported, in June 2020, the Company reported to EPA and MPCA that it had not fully complied with elements of the inspection, characterization and\nwaste stream profile verification process of the Waste and Feedstream Analysis Plan (WAP/FAP) of its RCRA permit for its Cottage Grove incinerator. The Company and\nMPCA resolved the issues associated with the foregoing disclosure in a May 2022 stipulation agreement, and permanently retired the Cottage Grove hazardous waste\nincinerator in December 2021. In connection with the now closed incinerator, the Company in December 2022 received from EPA a draft Consent Agreement and Penalty\nOrder (CAFO) under the Clean Air Act, with a proposed civil penalty to resolve issues raised in a Finding of Violation issued in 2019. The Company is engaging with EPA in\ndiscussions towards resolving this matter. In October 2021, the Company received information requests from MPCA seeking additional toxicological and other information\nrelated to certain PFAS compounds.

The Company\u2019s environmental liabilities\nand insurance receivables are described below.\nEnvironmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\nThe Company periodically examines whether the contingent liabilities related to the environmental matters and litigation described above are probable and reasonably estimable\nbased on experience and ongoing developments in those matters, including discussions regarding negotiated resolutions. During 2022, as a result of ongoing review and recent\ndevelopments in ongoing environmental matters and litigation, the Company increased its accrual for PFAS-related other environmental liabilities by $\n659\n million since\nDecember 31, 2021 and made related payments of $\n479\n million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had recorded liabilities of $\n592\n million for \u201cother environmental\nliabilities.\u201d The accruals represent the Company\u2019s best estimate of the probable loss in connection with the environmental matters and PFAS-related matters and litigation\ndescribed above. The Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had recorded liabilities of $\n29\n million for estimated non-PFAS related \u201cenvironmental remediation\u201d costs to clean up, treat, or remove\nhazardous substances at current or former 3M manufacturing or third-party sites. The Company evaluates available facts with respect to each individual site each quarter and\nrecords liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies\nor the Company\u2019s commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-\nparty environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the\ncontamination and the nature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. The Company\nexpects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to \n20\n years.\nIt is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental\nlaws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. Developments may occur that could affect the Company\u2019s\ncurrent assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available regarding the environmental impact of the Company\u2019s operations and products; (ii)\nchanges in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including\nefforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible\nparties; and (v) the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors. For sites included in both \u201cenvironmental remediation liabilities\u201d and\n\u201cother environmental liabilities,\u201d at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy,\nincluding required post-remediation monitoring, the Company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the Company\u2019s\nconsolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at which remediation activity is largely ongoing, the Company cannot estimate a possible loss\nor range of possible loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons described above.\nThe Company has both pre-1986 general and product liability occurrence coverage and post-1985 occurrence reported product liability and other environmental coverage for\nenvironmental matters and litigation.

Various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this and future expected increases in the receivable, including (i) delays in or avoidance of\npayment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future, (iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers, and (iv) the scope of the insurers\u2019\npurported defenses and exclusions to avoid coverage.\n111", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5071, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da8ba5ce-e90b-4151-991d-eed16cc4dffb": {"__data__": {"id_": "da8ba5ce-e90b-4151-991d-eed16cc4dffb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "051a8928-5dcc-4294-ab97-629a97131eb3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "4bba14ebfa02e5977dcfb5f1e0410d84cca674f7d709da0dce7519f843d5baf5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "647a69c2-cfb1-40ba-b63a-ce9817d2a80e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "a386de0aa3ef6f2e63cef170e0da43746037f05fdbd0eb713d0abde1d8cc4a9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2d23cba2-81b6-41a5-befe-42c97f4747c1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9709c1f261da4f174b11affe9510c25ae00fbd5861d9a3dd31e8a1db483b24ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "T\nable of \nContents\nProduct Liability Litigation\nAearo Technologies sold Dual-Ended Combat Arms \u2013 Version 2 earplugs starting in about 2003. 3M acquired Aearo Technologies in 2008 and sold these earplugs from 2008\nthrough 2015, when the product was discontinued. 3M and Aearo Technologies believe the Combat Arms Earplugs were effective and safe when used properly, but\nnevertheless, as discussed below, face litigation from approximately \n232,000\n claimants. As noted in the \"Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation \u2014 Aearo Technologies\" section\nabove, in July 2022, the Aearo Entities voluntarily initiated chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking court supervision to establish a trust, funded by the\nCompany, to efficiently and equitably satisfy all claims determined to be entitled to compensation associated with these matters and those described in the earlier section\n\"Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation \u2014 Aearo Technologies\". 3M entered into an agreement with the Aearo Entities to fund this trust and to support the Aearo Entities as they\ncontinue to operate during the chapter 11 proceedings. 3M has committed $\n1.0\n billion to fund this trust and has committed an additional $\n0.2\n billion to fund projected related\ncase expenses. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will provide additional funding if required by the Aearo Entities. Related to these actions, which represent a\nchange in strategy for managing the Combat Arms Version 2 earplugs and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities, 3M reflected a pre-tax charge of\n$\n1.2\n billion (within selling, general and administrative expenses), inclusive of fees and net of related existing accruals, in the second quarter of 2022.\nAs a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, 3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities in the third quarter of 2022, resulting in a charge that was not material to 3M.

Also in December 2022, the parties to the Aearo bankruptcy\nagreed to extend the exclusivity period for Aearo to file a plan for reorganization to March 31, 2023. Confidential mediation is underway with court-appointed mediators and\nsettlement discussions between Aearo and the plaintiffs are ongoing.

The significant increase from year-end 2021 in the number of claimants is largely due to the number\nof claims moved from the administrative docket to the active docket as the result of the transition orders the multi-district litigation (MDL) judge began issuing at the end of\n2021 (as more fully described below), in addition to claims filed directly on the active docket in 2022. In April 2019, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation\ngranted motions to transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida to be managed in an MDL\nproceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. The plaintiffs and 3M filed preliminary summary judgment motions on the government contractor defense. In July 2020, the\nMDL court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion and denied the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, ruling that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not barred by the\ngovernment contractor defense. The court denied the Company\u2019s request to immediately certify the summary judgment ruling for appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit. In December 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to consolidate \nthree\n plaintiffs for the first bellwether trial, which began in March 2021.\nIn April 2021, 3M received an adverse jury verdict in the first bellwether trial. The jury awarded the \nthree\n plaintiffs less than $\n1\n million in compensatory damages and\n$\n6\n million in punitive damages for a total of $\n7\n million. 3M appealed the verdicts, challenging, among other rulings, the MDL court's denial of 3M\u2019s motion to assert the\ngovernment contractor defense. The next \ntwo\n bellwether trials occurred in May and June of 2021. In May 2021, 3M received a verdict in its favor in the second bellwether\ntrial, in which a jury rejected claims that 3M knowingly sold earplugs with design defects. In June 2021, 3M received an adverse verdict in the third bellwether trial. The jury\nfound 3M liable for strict liability failure to warn, but found 3M not liable for design defect or fraud. The jury apportioned fault \n62\n percent to 3M and \n38\n percent to the\nplaintiff for a total damage award of approximately $\n1\n million. 3M appealed the verdict. In January 2023, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled oral argument for\nthe appeals of the first and third bellwether trials for the week of May 1, 2023. In October 2021, 3M received an adverse verdict in the fourth bellwether trial, in which a jury\nawarded $\n8\n million to the plaintiff. 3M received verdicts in its favor in the fifth and sixth bellwether trials. 3M received an adverse verdict in the seventh and eighth\nbellwether trials, in which the juries awarded the plaintiffs $\n13\n million and $\n23\n million, respectively. A post-trial order reduced the award in the seventh bellwether trial to\n$\n8\n million. 3M prevailed in the ninth and tenth bellwether cases but received adverse verdicts in the eleventh bellwether case in which the jury awarded each of the \ntwo\nplaintiffs $\n15\n million in compensatory and $\n40\n million in punitive damages. A post-trial order reduced the compensatory and punitive damages award to \none\n of the plaintiffs\nfrom $\n55\n million to $\n22\n million. 3M received adverse verdicts in the twelfth and thirteenth bellwether cases in which the jury awarded \none\n plaintiff with $\n50\n million and\nanother with $\n8\n million in compensatory damages. 3M prevailed in the fourteenth bellwether trial.

Plaintiff in the fourteenth bellwether trial has filed a notice of appeal. In\nDecember 2022, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her Eleventh Circuit appeal of a jury verdict in favor of 3M and Aearo. No other cases that resulted in a defense verdict are\non appeal before the Eleventh Circuit at this time. In April 2022, a jury returned a plaintiff\u2019s verdict in the fifteenth bellwether trial, awarding $\n2.2\n million in compensatory\ndamages and declining to award punitive damages. A post-trial order reduced the compensatory damages award to $\n1.2\n million. In May 2022, a jury returned a plaintiff\u2019s\nverdict in the last scheduled federal bellwether trial. The jury awarded $\n5\n million in compensatory damages and $\n72\n million in punitive damages. These trials have not\nincluded several bellwether cases that plaintiffs' counsel dismissed with prejudice either during discovery or after being set for trial. The Company's appeals to the Eleventh\nCircuit from the adverse verdicts are proceeding forward, with oral argument on the first two appeals scheduled for May 2023. Other than the Company's funding\ncommitment for its Aearo subsidiaries' chapter 11 proceedings as described above, no liability has been recorded for the Combat Arms earplugs litigation because the\nCompany believes any such liability is not probable and reasonably estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss at this time.\nFollowing conclusion of the bellwether trial process and unsuccessful settlement discussions, and with another \n2,000\n cases being prepared for trial while the Company's\nappeals are still pending, the Aearo Entities and the Company adopted a change in strategy for managing these alleged litigation liabilities that led to the Aearo Entities\ninitiating the chapter 11 proceedings as discussed above. An administrative docket of approximately \n90,700\n unfiled and unverified claims has also been maintained at the\nMDL court. The MDL court in August 2021 provided notice of an intent to issue forthcoming transition orders requiring all claims be moved off the administrative docket to\nthe active docket on a rolling basis over 12 months. The orders will provide that any case not moved to the active docket will be dismissed without prejudice, and the\nadministrative docket will then be closed. The MDL court also ordered the parties to prepare for trial \n2,000\n cases in \nfour\n waves of \n500\n cases over the next \n14\n months. After\nthe preparation of these cases is completed, the cases will be remanded to the federal district courts where the cases were originally filed. In October 2022, the MDL court\nordered that while the successor liability issue described below is on appeal, all wave discovery would be stayed, the transition of cases from the administrative docket to the\nactive docket would stop, and that monthly settlement conferences involving all parties (except Aearo) would occur in the MDL. In January 2023, the MDL judge ordered\nthat the MDL mediation would stop while the bankruptcy court mediation is ongoing.\n113", "start_char_idx": 3143, "end_char_idx": 6839, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46b22802-d316-48bf-8b42-8ef24087c268": {"__data__": {"id_": "46b22802-d316-48bf-8b42-8ef24087c268", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0cdc1004-9284-4b3e-855f-93777e2212c6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "670a3a2bc6446ef9f3ac104eaf408bd7fabc6af8afca55b2ff7e060c43f12944", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "64353c4d-496a-4f1d-9a08-0ec2d4939ef8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "4e442f0706df17f89fb49252602f409276fb50a3e58b970269ce686caf12cd0d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7dc08fa1-d71b-4290-af55-d0580cff8fe8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "44fb5a4bc822acae6f9c5af0ed5896f7babbfa78d7240b47edbbd5dd1e2d5ffd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "T\nable of \nContents\nThe court ordered a three-day mediation in July 2022; and again in September 2022, a two-day mediation session. The court also set the date for a single plaintiff trial for\nOctober 2022, which was postponed to February 2023, and then stayed. In August 2022, subsequent to Aearo\u2019s chapter 11 filing, the MDL court issued an order prohibiting\n3M from attempting to relitigate issues in the bankruptcy court and from financially supporting any collateral dispute regarding the MDL court\u2019s previous rulings. 3M has\nappealed the order to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and made a motion to stay the order pending appeal. In October 2022, the Eleventh Circuit granted 3M\u2019s motion\nto stay the order pending appeal. In January 2023, the Eleventh Circuit scheduled oral argument for this appeal for the week of May 1, 2023.\nIn September 2022, two MDL plaintiffs filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, seeking to permanently enjoin 3M from transferring\nassets, issuing dividends or completing the announced spin-off of its Health Care business, to allegedly preserve assets for the Combat Arms claimants. The Company has\nfiled a motion to dismiss the lawsuit and an opposition to the injunction motion. In December 2022, the court dismissed the lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds. Also in\nDecember 2022, the MDL court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment that successor liability, claiming that 3M is fully and independently liable for injuries\nallegedly caused by the CAEv2 and certified the order for appeal to the Eleventh Circuit. In January 2023, 3M sought the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s acceptance of the appeal. 3M is\nalso defending lawsuits brought primarily by non-military plaintiffs in state court in Hennepin County, Minnesota. 3M removed these actions to federal court, and the federal\ncourt remanded them to state court in March 2020. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled in October 2021 that the cases brought by non-military\nplaintiffs were properly remanded to state court, whereas the cases brought by military contractor plaintiffs who had received the Combat Arms Earplugs from the military\nshould have remained in federal court. In November 2021, the Eighth Circuit granted 3M's unopposed motion to vacate the remand orders in the remaining appeals of\nmilitary service member cases. The military service member cases are expected to be remanded to federal court and transferred to the MDL. There are approximately \n40\nlawsuits involving approximately \n1,000\n plaintiffs pending in the state court. The state court cases are subject to a bellwether case selection process.

In January 2018, the Minnesota state court excluded plaintiffs\u2019 experts and\ngranted 3M\u2019s motion for summary judgment on general causation. The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the state court orders in their entirety and the Minnesota Supreme\nCourt denied plaintiffs\u2019 petition for review and entered the final dismissal in 2019, effectively ending the Minnesota state court cases.\nIn June 2016, the Company was served with a putative class action filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for all Canadian residents who underwent various joint\narthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections that the representative plaintiff claims were due to the use of the Bair Hugger\u2122\npatient warming system. The representative plaintiff seeks relief (including punitive damages) under Canadian law based on theories similar to those asserted in the MDL.\nFor product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible\nloss in excess of the established accruals at this time.\nSecurities and Shareholder Litigation\nIn July 2019, Heavy & General Laborers\u2019 Locals 472 & 172 Welfare Fund filed a putative securities class action against 3M Company, its former Chairman and CEO, current\nChairman and CEO, and former CFO in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In August 2019, an individual plaintiff filed a similar putative securities class\naction in the same district. Plaintiffs allege that defendants made false and misleading statements regarding 3M's exposure to liability associated with PFAS and bring claims for\ndamages under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 against all defendants, and under Section 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of\n1934 against the individual defendants. In October 2019, the court consolidated the securities class actions and appointed a group of lead plaintiffs. In January 2020, the\ndefendants filed a motion to transfer venue to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. In August 2020, the court denied the motion to transfer venue, and in\nSeptember 2020, the defendants filed a petition for writ of mandamus to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In November 2020, the federal Court of Appeals\ngranted 3M\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus and directed the New Jersey federal court to transfer the action to the Minnesota federal court. The defendants filed a motion to\ndismiss the action in January 2021, and in September 2021, the Minnesota federal court granted 3M\u2019s motion to dismiss the securities class action, which judgment is now final.\nIn October 2019, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against 3M and several of its current and former executives\nand directors. In November and December 2019, \ntwo\n additional derivative lawsuits were filed in a Minnesota state court. The derivative lawsuits rely on similar factual\nallegations as the putative securities class action discussed above. The Minnesota state court cases were consolidated and stayed pending a decision on the motion to dismiss in\nthe securities class action, and the Minnesota state plaintiffs have agreed to further stay their action pending a decision on the motion to dismiss the federal derivative lawsuit\ndiscussed below.

Awards may be issued in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,\nrestricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and performance shares. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining shares available for grant\nunder the LTIP Program are \n32\n million and there were approximately \n8,357\n participants with outstanding options, restricted stock, or restricted stock units.\nThe Company\u2019s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February to provide a strong and immediate link between the performance of individuals during\nthe preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants. The grant to eligible employees uses the closing stock price on the grant date. Accounting rules\nrequire recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. Employees\nare considered eligible to retire at age \n55\n and after having completed \nten years\n of service. This retiree-eligible population represents \n36\n percent of the annual grant stock-based\ncompensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter.\nIn addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants. The Company issues cash settled\nrestricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries. These grants do not result in the issuance of common stock and are considered immaterial by the\nCompany.\nAmounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units,\nperformance shares and the General Employees\u2019 Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP), are provided in the following table.

Weighted average restricted stock unit shares outstanding are included in the computation of diluted\nearnings per share.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $\n108\n million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units. This\nexpense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of \n23\n months. The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that\nvested during December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n88\n million, $\n83\n million and $\n91\n million, respectively. The Company\u2019s actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions\nrelated to the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n17\n million, $\n16\n million and $\n17\n million, respectively.\nPerformance Shares\nInstead of restricted stock units, the Company makes annual grants of performance shares to members of its executive management. The 2022 performance criteria for these\nperformance shares (organic sales growth, free cash flow growth, and earnings per share growth) were selected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of\nlong-term stockholder value. The number of shares of 3M common stock that could actually be delivered at the end of the \nthree-year\n performance period may be anywhere\nfrom \n0\n% to \n200\n% of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the Company during such performance period. When granted, these performance shares\nare awarded at \n100\n% of the estimated number of shares at the end of the \nthree-year\n performance period and are reflected under \u201cGranted\u201d in the table below. Non-substantive\nvesting requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over \none\n or \nthree years\n depending on when each individual became a 3M executive. The performance\nshare grants accrue dividends; therefore, the grant date fair value is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no\nimpact on basic earnings per share calculations.

In July 2022, 3M announced its\nintention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company (see Note 3 for additional information). Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at\ncost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent\nthat these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment\noperating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in \u201cCorporate and Unallocated\u201d).\nEffective in the first quarter of 2022, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M\u2019s chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M\u2019s\ndisclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income (loss) ) was updated. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to\nhow the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company\u2019s business segments. The changes included the items described below. The financial information\npresented herein reflects the impact of these business segment reporting changes for all periods presented.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2022:\nEliminating inclusion of dual credit in measure of segment operating performance\n3M business segment operating performance measures were updated to no longer include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income.\nManagement previously evaluated its business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting. 3M reflected additional\n(\u201cdual\u201d) credit to another business segment when the customer account activity (\u201csales district\u201d) with respect to the particular product sold to the external customer was\nprovided by a different business segment. For example, privacy screen protection products are primarily sold by the Display Materials and Systems Division within the\nTransportation and Electronics business segment; however, certain sales districts within the Consumer business segment provide the customer account activity for sales of the\nproduct to particular customers. In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Consumer) previously would also have received credit for the associated net sales initiated\nthrough its sales district and the related approximate operating income.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4642, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77e164c2-fa8e-41dd-8e4c-89e6f1790423": {"__data__": {"id_": "77e164c2-fa8e-41dd-8e4c-89e6f1790423", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "47c26f65-fbf3-46a0-aa1c-8e450d53a469", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "9c354944d71cee5c1e866c4cd85ed4ac4609f752f6c4d806dc50484ab0521975", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b086ff4-595d-42a7-81cc-d59e43d3f873", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/quynhle/Desktop/project-local/st-openssa/openssa/examples/FinanceBench/.data/docs/3M_2022_10K/3M_2022_10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1655681, "creation_date": "2024-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-11"}, "hash": "24b8f7ce195f5f45da67186aedfce93c3abe965c1add299e88912abe3db575bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "edcab046-710f-4469-9062-1e0c6528dc66", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "46b816be639e680a2061be794d32a95e44a453ef00170367d4c7a75b08c61013", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Management previously evaluated its business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting. 3M reflected additional\n(\u201cdual\u201d) credit to another business segment when the customer account activity (\u201csales district\u201d) with respect to the particular product sold to the external customer was\nprovided by a different business segment.

Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are effective.\nb.\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the Exchange\nAct Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in \nInternal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013).\n Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is effective. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has\nbeen audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an\nunqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\nc.\nThere was no change in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company\u2019s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has\nmaterially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and\nrelated transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The implementation of a worldwide ERP system will likely\naffect the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.\nThe Company completed implementation with respect to various processes/sub-processes in certain subsidiaries/locations, including aspects relative to the United States, and\nwill continue to roll out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new information technology application we implement, this application, along with the internal\ncontrols over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the testing for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances.\nWe concluded, as part of its evaluation described in the above paragraphs, that the implementation of the ERP system in these circumstances has not materially affected our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B. \nOther Information.\nDisclosure Under Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012\nThe Company is making the following disclosure under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act:\nProtection of Intellectual Property Rights in Iran Pursuant to Specific License\nAs part of its intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) protection efforts, 3M has obtained and maintains patents and trademarks in Iran.

adjusted cost base (\u201c\nACB\n\u201d) of the Shares. \nThe ACB ordinarily would equal the fair market value of the Shares at the\ntime of acquisition, but if Participant owns other Shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. \nThe form\nT1135 generally must be filed by April 30 of the following year. \nParticipant should consult with his or her personal advisor to

the\nPlan.\nExcept as provided in the Agreement or in the Plan, a Termination of Service for any reason (including for the reasons listed below) will\nautomatically result in the forfeiture of any unvested Option; in particular, Participant understands and agrees that, except as provided in\nthe Agreement and the Plan, the Option will be forfeited without entitlement to the underlying Shares or to any amount as indemnification in\nthe event of a Termination of Service prior to vesting by reason of, including, but not limited to, resignation, disciplinary dismissal with or\nwithout cause,

gratuitously, and in its sole discretion decided to grant options\nunder the Plan to individuals who may be Employees throughout the world. \nThe decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the\nexpress assumption and condition that any grant will not bind the Company or any Subsidiary, other than to the extent set forth in the\nAgreement. \nConsequently, Participant understands

would not be made but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, Participant\nacknowledges and freely accepts that, should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any\nreason, then any grant of or right to the Option shall be null and void.\nA-36", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3615, "text_template":
