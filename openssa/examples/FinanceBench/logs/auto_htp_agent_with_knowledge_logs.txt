WHAT IS THE PROPORTION OF 3M'S NET PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) TO TOTAL ASSETS FOR FY2022?
--------------------------
Based on the information provided from the resource named '3M_2022_10K', the proportion of 3M's net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) to total assets for the fiscal year 2022 (FY2022) is 19.75%. This specific value indicates that the net PP&E constitutes 19.75% of the company's total assets for the stated fiscal year. The resource appears to have provided a direct answer to the question posed, and since the value is a specific percentage, it meets the criteria for a confident answer with concrete results. The reasoning is straightforward: the proportion is calculated by dividing the net value of PP&E by the total assets and expressing the result as a percentage. The resource has presumably done this calculation using the exact figures from 3M's financial statements for FY2022.

WHAT IS THE RATIO OF 3M'S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (CAPEX) TO ITS TOTAL NET SALES FOR FY2022?
--------------------------
The ratio of 3M's capital expenditures (CapEx) to its total net sales for FY2022 cannot be determined with the information provided. The resource named '3M_2022_10K' does not explicitly provide the necessary figures to calculate this ratio. To calculate the ratio of CapEx to total net sales, one would need the specific value of 3M's capital expenditures for FY2022 as well as the company's total net sales for the same period. Since the resource does not provide these figures, it is not possible to confidently calculate the ratio without additional information.

IS 3M A CAPITAL-INTENSIVE BUSINESS BASED ON FY2022 DATA?
--------------------------
Based on the available FY2022 data for 3M, we can begin to assess whether it is a capital-intensive business by examining the proportion of net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) to total assets. The data indicates that 3M's net PP&E constitutes 19.75% of the company's total assets for FY2022. While this figure alone does not conclusively determine capital intensity, it does provide a significant indicator. Capital-intensive businesses typically have a high proportion of fixed assets relative to total assets. The threshold for being considered high can vary by industry, but a common benchmark is over 25%.

Since 3M's net PP&E to total assets ratio is 19.75%, it is below the 25% threshold, suggesting that 3M may not be highly capital-intensive relative to some industries. However, this does not rule out capital intensity entirely, as other factors also play a role.

Unfortunately, the ratio of 3M's capital expenditures (CapEx) to its total net sales for FY2022 is not available, which would have provided further insight into the company's capital intensity. Capital expenditures are a critical component of capital intensity, as they reflect the company's investment in fixed assets to maintain or expand operations. A high CapEx to sales ratio is often indicative of a capital-intensive business.

Additionally, the depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total net sales for FY2022 is not provided. This metric would have helped to understand the scale of 3M's investment in fixed assets and the associated depreciation, which is relevant for capital-intensive businesses that require substantial investment in long-term assets.

Lastly, the return on assets (RoA) for 3M for FY2022 is not available. RoA is an important metric for assessing how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate earnings. Capital-intensive businesses often have a lower RoA due to the large asset base required for operations.

In conclusion, based on the single data point of net PP&E to total assets ratio being 19.75%, 3M does not appear to be highly capital-intensive when applying the general benchmark of over 25%. However, without additional information on CapEx to sales ratio, depreciation and amortization expense relative to sales, and RoA, a definitive assessment of 3M's capital intensity cannot be made. It would be beneficial to have more comprehensive data to fully evaluate 3M's capital intensity in the context of its industry and operational model.

REASONING WITHOUT SUPPORTING/OTHER RESULTS (preliminary conclusions here can be overriden by more convincing supporting/other data):
Without specific FY2022 financial data for 3M, it is not possible to confidently determine whether 3M is a capital-intensive business. Capital-intensive businesses are typically characterized by high levels of fixed assets relative to total assets, significant capital expenditures relative to net sales, and a low return on assets. To make a concrete determination, one would need to analyze 3M's balance sheet to calculate the proportion of net fixed assets to total assets, review the income statement to assess capital expenditures relative to net sales, and calculate the return on assets. Additionally, comparing these figures to industry benchmarks would provide context for determining the level of capital intensity. Since the specific FY2022 financial figures and industry benchmarks are not provided, a confident conclusion cannot be reached.


SUPPORTING QUESTION/TASK #1:
What is the proportion of 3M's net property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) to total assets for FY2022?
