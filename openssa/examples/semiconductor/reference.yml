questions:
  - At wave vectors near but not exactly at the zone center, the LO phonon
    frequency in GaAs and other zinc-blende crystals is higher than that of the
    TO phonons. Why is this?
  - What is the typical thickness of the gate oxide layer in a 5nm FinFET
    transistor?
  - What is the thermal conductivity of silicon carbide (SiC) at 300 K?
  - What is the expected subthreshold swing of a 3nm gate-length InGaAs quantum
    well FET at room temperature?
  - What is the effect of donor and acceptor impurities on the Fermi level?
  - A MOSFET transistor has a threshold voltage of 0.5V and a drain-source
    current of 100mA. If the gate-source voltage is increased by 1V, and the
    drain-source voltage is increased by 2V, what will be the new drain-source
    current? Assume a mobility of 400 cm^2/Vs and a gate oxide thickness of 2nm.
  - A CMOS inverter circuit has a pull-up resistance of 1kohm and a pull-down
    resistance of 2kohm. If the input voltage is 2.5V and the output voltage is
    0.5V, what will be the power dissipation in the circuit? Assume a supply
    voltage of 5V and a switching frequency of 100MHz.
