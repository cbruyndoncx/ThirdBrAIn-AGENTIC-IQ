rf-power-fluctuation-monitoring:
  task: |-
    Monitor RF Power fluctuation and recommend inspection/maintenance actions if fluctuation is excessive

  sub-htps:
    - task: >-
        What are the values of Reflected Power in the recent data?

    - task: |-
        Analyze whether the lowest and highest Reflected Power values differ by more than 15%.
        If so, note down the corresponding wafer batch number range between them.

    - task: >-
        What are the values of Forward Power in the recent data?

    - task: |-
        Analyze whether the lowest and highest Forward Power values differ by more than 10%.
        If so, note down the corresponding wafer batch number range between them.

    - task: |-
        If there are excessive fluctuations in both Reflected Power and Forward Power in the previous analyses,
        and if the wafer batch number ranges overlap, report a RF Power Fluctuation problem,
        and recommend the following maintenance actions:
        - Inspect the electrodes
        - Adjust gas flow
        - Adjust power settings


pressure-instability-monitoring:
  task: |-
    Monitor Chamber Pressure fluctuation and recommend inspection/maintenance actions if fluctuation is excessive

  sub-htps:
    - task: >-
        What are the values of Chamber Pressure in the recent data?

    - task: |-
        Analyze whether there are consecutive Chamber Pressure values differing by at least 3%.
        If so, note down the corresponding wafer batch numbers.

    - task: >-
        What are the values of Gas Flow Rate in the recent data?

    - task: |-
        Analyze whether there are consecutive Gas Flow Rate values differing by at least 5%.
        If so, note down the corresponding wafer batch numbers.

    - task: |-
        If there are excessive fluctuations in both Chamber Pressure and Gas Flow Rate in the previous analyses,
        and if the wafer batch numbers contain some same batch(es), report a Pressure Instability problem,
        and recommend the following maintenance actions:
        - Preventative chamber cleaning
        - Adjustment of the gas flow to stabilize pressure


chamber-temperature-monitoring:
  task: |-
    Monitor Chamber Temperature increases and recommend inspection/maintenance actions if heating is excessive

  sub-htps:
    - task: >-
        What are the values of Chamber Temperature in the recent data?

    - task: |-
        Analyze whether there are 3 consecutive Chamber Temperature values
        showing increases of at least 2 Celcius degrees from first to second and from second to third

    - task: |-
        If there is/are significant Chamber Temperature increase(s) identified in the previous analysis,
        recommend the following maintenance actions:
        - Adjustment of chamber clean frequency
        - Alerting engineers to check wall lining for polymer build-up
