Duryodhana Seeks Gandhari's Blessing ~\r\nThe war continued day after day after day.\r\nEach morning, Duryodhana would go to his mother and ask for her blessing. Gandhari's pious devotion gave her enormous power, so what she said always came true.\r\n\"Mother, please say 'May my sons win,'\" Duryodhana would ask her.\r\nGandhari, however, would only say, \"May the right side win.\"\r\nDhritarashtra protested. \"Whether he's right or not, Duryodhana is our son.\"\r\nBut Gandhari repeated, \"May the right side win,\" and all the while she grieved for her hundred sons as Bhima killed them, one by one by one.\r\nSoon, there would be none left.\r\n\r\n~ 150. Bhima Fights Karna ~\r\nThe next day, Bhima killed twelve more of Duryodhana's brothers. \"I will kill them all,\" he thought to himself, \"Duryodhana and all his brothers!\"\r\nThen when Bhima saw Karna, he turned his chariot to pursue him, but Karna shattered Bhima's bow, broke his mace, and killed Bhima's charioteer.", "start_char_idx": 94476, "end_char_idx": 96240, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e2f3ec3-d2b9-4dcc-b2ab-d0a4c4c0cd71": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e2f3ec3-d2b9-4dcc-b2ab-d0a4c4c0cd71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\PycharmProjects\\motleycrew\\mahabharata\\text\\TinyTales\\mahabharata.txt", "file_name": "mahabharata.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 129251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa6b25f-c497-42bb-b323-a12de8fde12d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\PycharmProjects\\motleycrew\\mahabharata\\text\\TinyTales\\mahabharata.txt", "file_name": "mahabharata.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 129251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "d03dc0fac1c9d7905dbaa78c04a09d166ba96e09f99e2ed69eca75ff0734e357", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eca36859-775c-49bf-a08a-4857f3a2db0b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\User\\PycharmProjects\\motleycrew\\mahabharata\\text\\TinyTales\\mahabharata.txt", "file_name": "mahabharata.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 129251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "cb958023c89d940e0ada33fa84cc278c24eb5556078e2af327fbd50243047ea4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "283a69e0-0505-4ad0-a408-8fdd7b248630", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e524d6cf133702c465776eaef70f7f6bbd53e0c93c36c88b52f5424d406f3dc5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\"Mother, please say 'May my sons win,'\" Duryodhana would ask her.\r\nGandhari, however, would only say, \"May the right side win.\"\r\nDhritarashtra protested. \"Whether he's right or not, Duryodhana is our son.\"\r\nBut Gandhari repeated, \"May the right side win,\" and all the while she grieved for her hundred sons as Bhima killed them, one by one by one.\r\nSoon, there would be none left.\r\n\r\n~ 150.

The epic begins with the story of King Shantanu, the Pandavas' great-grandfather, and ends with King Janamejaya, the Pandavas' great-grandson. You will meet Draupadi, the heroine who is married to all five of the Pandava brothers, and you will also meet Krishna, the human avatar of the god Vishnu who sides with the Pandavas in the war. For first-time Mahabharata readers, I've included a list of characters in an appendix to the book, and you'll find additional notes at:\r\nMahabharata.LauraGibbs.net\r\n\r\nThe paragraph you just read about the Mahabharata is 100 words long, as is this paragraph, and that's also the length of each episode in this book. The episodes go fast, but you can slow down when you find one you like. Read it again. Let it sink in. You might even write your own versions of your favorite episodes, using your imagination to add more details. Meanwhile, if you get confused by a particular episode, don't get bogged down; just keep reading! You can find more 100-word stories from the Mahabharata, along with a \"Tiny Tales\" Ramayana, at:\r\n100Words.LauraGibbs.net\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nFor story-specific bibliography and notes, visit:\r\nMahabharata.LauraGibbs.net\r\n\r\nGanguli, Kisari Mohan.
