This process is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements 'bubble' to the top of the list. The outer loop runs n times, and the inner loop runs n-i-1 times, where n is the length of the list and i is the current iteration of the outer loop. An optimization is added with a flag to detect if any swapping happened in the inner loop. If no swapping happened, the list is already sorted, and the loop can be terminated early. The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, and O(n) in the best case when the list is already sorted. The space complexity is O(1) as it is an in-place sorting algorithm.\")\u001b[0m\n",

       "The bubble sort algorithm works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements 'bubble' to the top of the list. The outer loop runs n times, and the inner loop runs n-i-1 times, where n is the length of the list and i is the current iteration of the outer loop. An optimization is added with a flag to detect if any swapping happened in the inner loop. If no swapping happened, the list is already sorted, and the loop can be terminated early. The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, and O(n) in the best case when the list is already sorted. The space complexity is O(1) as it is an in-place sorting algorithm."
