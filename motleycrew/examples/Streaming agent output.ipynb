    "# Streaming agent output\n",
    "\n",
    "In some applications, especially where humans are involved, output streaming can be useful for improving responsiveness. LLMs can take a while to generate output, and if there is a human on the other end, it would be much better if they'll instantly see the output being generated in real time, rather than wait for 30 seconds for the output to be fully generated and displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll demonstrate how this can be achieved in motleycrew using Langchain callbacks. In the first example, we'll stream agent output to the console while it solves a task inside a crew. The second example will show a standalone agent that asynchronously streams its output to a web client using WebSockets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that streaming in this fashion is currently only possible with Langchain-based agents. Please file a GitHub issue if you'd like to see other frameworks supported."
