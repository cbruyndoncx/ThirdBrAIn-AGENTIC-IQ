"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nArjuna killed Karna, his half-brother, under the command and justification of Krishna. During their battle, Karna's chariot got stuck in the mud, and he was unable to remember the mantra to launch the Brahmastra. Karna called out to Arjuna and Krishna, claiming they were honor-bound to let him fix his chariot. Krishna responded by questioning the honor in Karna's past actions, specifically mentioning the humiliation of Draupadi and the killing of Abhimanyu while he was defenseless. Krishna argued that Karna's previous dishonorable deeds forfeited any claim to honor, thus justifying his death even while he was defenseless. Following Krishna's command, Arjuna hesitated but ultimately obeyed and killed Karna."
