It takes a list `arr` as input and sorts it in ascending order. The algorithm works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted. The outer loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list, and the inner loop runs `n-i-1` times to avoid re-checking the already sorted elements. The sorted list is then returned."
