## Overview

When an agent with self-reflection enabled processes a task:
1. It generates an initial response using its tools and capabilities
2. The agent then reflects on its own response, evaluating:
   - Completeness
   - Accuracy
   - Relevance
   - Quality
3. Based on this reflection, the agent may revise and improve its response
4. This cycle can repeat until the agent is satisfied with the quality

## Usage

Self-reflection is enabled by default for all agents. You can explicitly control it using the `self_reflect` parameter:

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    role="Senior Research Analyst",
    goal="Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI",
    backstory="You are an expert at analyzing tech trends",
    self_reflect=True  # Enable self-reflection (default)
)
```

## Benefits

- **Higher Quality Outputs**: Agents can catch and correct potential issues before delivering responses
- **More Reliable Task Completion**: Self-reflection helps ensure all aspects of a task are properly addressed
- **Conscious Decision Making**: Agents evaluate their own work, leading to more thoughtful responses
- **Improved Accuracy**: Multiple reflection cycles help refine and perfect the output

## Integration with Processes

Self-reflection works seamlessly with both sequential and hierarchical processes:

- **Sequential**: Each agent self-reflects on their individual tasks
- **Hierarchical**: Agents self-reflect before reporting to the manager agent, ensuring high-quality inputs for decision-making

## Example

Here's a complete example showing self-reflection in action:

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents

researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    role="Senior Research Analyst",
    goal="Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI",
    backstory="You are an expert at analyzing tech trends",
    self_reflect=True,
    llm="gpt-4o"
)

task = Task(
    name="research_task",
    description="Analyze 2024's AI advancements",
    expected_output="A detailed report on AI trends",
    agent=researcher
)

agents = PraisonAIAgents(
    agents=[researcher],
    tasks=[task],
    process="sequential"
)

result = agents.start()
```

In this example, the researcher agent will:
1. Research AI advancements
2. Generate an initial report
3. Self-reflect on the report's quality
4. Make improvements if needed
5. Deliver the final, refined output

## Performance Impact

While self-reflection adds additional processing time, the improvement in output quality often justifies the extra computation. 
The number of reflection cycles need to be manually optimized to balance quality and performance.
